# 00_intent.md — OGZPrime Meta-Pack Intent

## 1. What this meta-pack is for
This pack exists to give an AI everything it needs to understand OGZPrime without re-explaining shit every time.  
It is the single source of truth for context.

## 2. What problems it solves
- No more losing context between sessions.
- No more reintroducing the architecture.
- No more repeating the same warnings and rules.
- No more wasted warmup time.

## 3. What the AI should be able to do after reading it
- Understand OGZPrime’s architecture.
- Understand each module’s purpose.
- Follow rules and guardrails.
- Avoid known landmines/mistakes.
- Know the current focus of development.
- Know the latest major changes.
- Apply “Trey Brain” lessons automatically.

## 4. What it should NOT contain
- No raw transcripts.
- No full code dumps.
- No giant changelogs (only summaries).
- No rambling explanations.
- No speculation.
- No outdated information.

## 5. Sources we will pull from
- Existing changelogs.
- Dev notes.
- Trey Brain lessons taken from previous convos.
- Module descriptions.
- High-level architecture docs.
- Any “burned by this before” items.

## 6. The style we expect
- Bullet points, not essays.
- Short, dense summaries.
- Brutal clarity.
- No placeholders.
- Always up-to-date with the current repo.

## 7. The end goal
After reading this pack, an AI should behave like it already knows OGZPrime and has worked on it for months.

## 8. The scope of v1
- Only OGZPrime.
- Only the modules we actually use right now.
- Only the rules we know matter today.
- Later we can expand.

## 9. How this will be used
- Paste into new Claude/ChatGPT sessions.
- Feed into RAG later.
- Act as onboarding for any future dev or agent.
- Keep OGZPrime work consistent.
