## RETRIEVED CONTEXT
# Retrieved Context

## Relevant Past Fixes:
- **FIX-659-SUMMARY**: Fixed feature data conversion in pattern pipeline
  - Root cause: The pattern recording pipeline lost features data when converting from pattern objects to the record
  - Files: 
  - ✅ Worked: Preserving features array through pipeline
  - ❌ Failed: String signature truncation
- **FIX-659-INDEX**: Fixed feature data conversion in pattern pipeline
  - Root cause: See report
  - Files: v2.js, v2.js, EnhancedPatternRecognition.js, RiskManager.js
  - ✅ Worked: Preserving features array through pipeline
  - ❌ Failed: String signature truncation
- **FIX-2025-12-25-RECURSIVE-RATE-LIMITER-STACK-O**: - **File**: `kraken_adapter_simple.js` lines 109-204
  - Root cause: - Rate limiter used recursion for retries
- On 429 errors, created infinite promise chain
- Stack ov
  - Files: kraken_adapter_simple.js, run-empire-v2.js
  - ✅ Worked: No more stack overflow on rate limits

## Relevant Reports:
### VERIFY-FIX-659.md
# Check if features are being passed correctly
grep -n "pattern.features" /opt/ogzprime/OGZPMLV2/run-empire-v2.js
# Expected: 2 matches (lines 757, 1311)

# If missing, re-apply fix:
# Check exact line numbers and reapply changes
```

### Issue: File not updating

```bash
# Ensure data directory is writable
ls -ld /opt/ogzprime/OGZPMLV2/data/
# Expected: drwx...... (writable)

# Check for permission errors
npm start 2>&1 | grep -i "permission\|denied\|write"

## Claudito Rules of Engagement

1. **Single Purpose**: Each Claudito does ONE thing excellently
2. **No Scope Creep**: Stay within assigned boundaries
3. **Document Everything**: Especially in CHANGELOG
4. **Communicate via Hooks**: No direct calls between Clauditos
5. **Preserve Context**: Pass full state in hooks
6. **Respect Architecture**: Don't change what works
7. **Test Before Ship**: Never skip validation
8. **Emergency Stop**: Halt on critical errors
9. **Forensics Takes Priority...

## Architecture/Guardrails:
### From claudito_context.md:
 Upgrade Path

- **New Brains** (ML/quantum/neuromorphic)
  - Plug in at the **Signal/Brain** layer.
  - Must emit the standard decision schema used by ExecutionLayer.

- **New Brokers**
  - Implement a broker adapter that speaks:
    - `placeOrder`, `cancelOrder`, `getPositions`, `getBalance`, etc.
  - ExecutionLayer routes through the adapter instead of talking per-broker APIs directly....

03 — Modules Overview (OGZPrime Ecosystem Architecture)

(Structured from Trey’s design intent, mission, and raw system knowledge)

Overview

OGZPrime isn’t a single bot — it is a modular, extensible trading ecosystem built to be:

safe (no blown accounts)

stable (no disconnects, no silent failures)

transparent (no black-box ML lies)

adaptive (patterns, volatility, regimes)

upg...

### From 07_trey-brain-lessons.md:
# Onboarding Before Touching Code

I don’t want:

- cocky cold-start behavior,
- “I got this from a quick scan,”
- bots that refactor systems they don’t understand.

What you MUST do before changing anything:

1. Read the packed context (`claudito_context.md`).
2. Read the **full** changelog, not just the top segment.
3. Map the architecture:
   - where data comes in,
   - how signal...



## ⚠️ USER VERIFICATION REQUIRED
**NO CHANGES WILL BE MADE AUTOMATICALLY**

This is a diagnostic report only. Review the analysis and suggested fixes below.
All changes require explicit user approval before implementation.

## SUGGESTED APPROACH
1. Known issue - see similar fixes below
2. **REVIEW**: User reviews suggested fixes from past issues
3. **APPROVE**: User selects which approach to take
4. **IMPLEMENT**: User or approved agent implements fix
5. **TEST**: Run smoke tests on affected subsystems
6. **DOCUMENT**: Update CHANGELOG and Fix Ledger

## RISK MAP TEMPLATE (FOR REFERENCE)
```javascript
{
  file: "path/to/file.js",
  line: 123,
  root_cause: "...",
  minimal_fix: "...",
  required_tests: ["smoke test X", "verify Y"],
  telemetry: ["monitor metric Z"]
}
```

## RULES
- NO action without context
- NO fixes without forensics Risk Map
- NO commits without tests
- EVERY fix updates the ledger

To proceed, run the mission chain with this plan as context.
