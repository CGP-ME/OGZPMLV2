## ISSUE
bot stuck in paper trading mode not executing live trades

## TRIAGE RESULTS
- **Severity**: HIGH
- **Category**: TRADING
- **Subsystems**: ExecutionLayer, MaxProfitManager
- **Containment**: 

## FORCED EVAL (COMMITMENT)
```
RAG_RETRIEVAL: YES - Must retrieve architecture and past fixes
FORENSICS: MAYBE - Similar issue found, may reuse fix
FIXER: NO
DEBUGGER: NO
TESTS: NO
DEPLOYMENT: NO
```

## SIMILAR PAST FIXES
- FIX-659-SUMMARY: Fixed feature data conversion in pattern pipeline
- FIX-2025-12-25-STATE-DESYNCHRONIZATION: - **File**: `run-empire-v2.js` (multiple locations)
- FIX-659-INDEX: Fixed feature data conversion in pattern pipeline

## RETRIEVED CONTEXT
# Retrieved Context

## Relevant Past Fixes:
- **FIX-659-SUMMARY**: Fixed feature data conversion in pattern pipeline
  - Root cause: The pattern recording pipeline lost features data when converting from pattern objects to the record
  - Files: 
  - ✅ Worked: Preserving features array through pipeline
  - ❌ Failed: String signature truncation
- **FIX-2025-12-25-STATE-DESYNCHRONIZATION**: - **File**: `run-empire-v2.js` (multiple locations)
  - Root cause: - Three different sources of "truth" tracking the same data:
  - `this.currentPosition` in main bot 
  - Files: run-empire-v2.js
  - ✅ Worked: StateManager is now the ONLY source of truth
- **FIX-659-INDEX**: Fixed feature data conversion in pattern pipeline
  - Root cause: See report
  - Files: v2.js, v2.js, EnhancedPatternRecognition.js, RiskManager.js
  - ✅ Worked: Preserving features array through pipeline
  - ❌ Failed: String signature truncation

### SURGICAL-FIXES-REPORT.md
# SURGICAL ENGINE SWAP - CRITICAL ARCHITECTURE FIXES
## OGZPrime Trading Bot v2.0.24 - 2025-12-13

### EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Fixed 5 critical architectural flaws that were causing state desynchronization, blocking behavior, persistence failures, and incorrect trading decisions. The sophisticated trading logic ("Ferrari") was being crippled by primitive infrastructure ("matchbox car engine"). All fixes were surgical - no grandiose rewrites, just targeted precision fixes.

2. Run VERIFY-FIX-659.md testing procedures
3. Check data/pattern-memory.json for growth
4. Monitor bot decision quality improvement
5. Review FIX-659-SUMMARY.md after test passes

## Architecture/Guardrails:
### From claudito_context.md:
 Upgrade Path

- **New Brains** (ML/quantum/neuromorphic)
  - Plug in at the **Signal/Brain** layer.
  - Must emit the standard decision schema used by ExecutionLayer.

- **New Brokers**
  - Implement a broker adapter that speaks:
    - `placeOrder`, `cancelOrder`, `getPositions`, `getBalance`, etc.
  - ExecutionLayer routes through the adapter instead of talking per-broker APIs directly....

Overview

OGZPrime isn’t a single bot — it is a modular, extensible trading ecosystem built to be:

safe (no blown accounts)

stable (no disconnects, no silent failures)

transparent (no black-box ML lies)

adaptive (patterns, volatility, regimes)

# OGZPrime — Purpose & Vision

OGZPrime exists for one reason: to give Trey the freedom and stability to be a
present father for his daughter, Annamarie. Everything in this ecosystem traces
back to that core mission: build something powerful enough, reliable enough, and
profitable enough to change a life permanently.

What began as a simple crypto bot grew into a full trading ecosystem. OGZ...



## ⚠️ USER VERIFICATION REQUIRED
**NO CHANGES WILL BE MADE AUTOMATICALLY**

This is a diagnostic report only. Review the analysis and suggested fixes below.
All changes require explicit user approval before implementation.

## SUGGESTED APPROACH
1. Known issue - see similar fixes below
2. **REVIEW**: User reviews suggested fixes from past issues
3. **APPROVE**: User selects which approach to take
4. **IMPLEMENT**: User or approved agent implements fix
5. **TEST**: Run smoke tests on affected subsystems
6. **DOCUMENT**: Update CHANGELOG and Fix Ledger

## RISK MAP TEMPLATE (FOR REFERENCE)
```javascript
{
  file: "path/to/file.js",
  line: 123,
  root_cause: "...",
  minimal_fix: "...",
  required_tests: ["smoke test X", "verify Y"],
  telemetry: ["monitor metric Z"]
}
```

## RULES
- NO action without context
- NO fixes without forensics Risk Map
- NO commits without tests
- EVERY fix updates the ledger

To proceed, run the mission chain with this plan as context.
