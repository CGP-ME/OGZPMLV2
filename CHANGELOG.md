## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Pattern Learning Summary in Backtest Output** - run-empire-v2.js, core/EnhancedPatternRecognition.js (FEATURE) - 2026-02-02
  - Visual proof that pattern learning pipeline is fully functional
  - Shows at backtest completion: Patterns Recorded, Wins, Losses, Win Rate
  - Aggregate stats from PatternMemorySystem.getStats()
  - **Example output:**
    ```
    🧠 PATTERN LEARNING SUMMARY:
       📊 Patterns Recorded: 5
       ✅ Wins: 3
       ❌ Losses: 2
       📈 Win Rate: 60.0%
    ```

- **TRAI Universal Web Context** - run-empire-v2.js, core/trai_core.js (FEATURE)
  - TRAI now fetches REAL market data before responding to queries
  - Auto-detects asset from query: "How's Ethereum?" → fetches ETH data
  - **Crypto support (CoinGecko API):** BTC, ETH, SOL, ADA, XRP, DOGE, DOT, AVAX, LINK, MATIC, LTC
  - **Stock support (Yahoo Finance API):** AAPL, TSLA, MSFT, GOOGL, AMZN, NVDA, META, NFLX, SPY, QQQ
  - Data includes: 24h/7d/30d changes, ATH, distance from ATH, market sentiment
  - No more hallucinating "near recent highs" when market is at 6-month low
  - **Files:** `run-empire-v2.js` (fetchWebMarketContext, detectAssetFromQuery, fetchCryptoContext, fetchStockContext)
  - **Files:** `core/trai_core.js` (rich prompt with asset-specific data from web)

- **TRAI Response Quality Fixes** - core/persistent_llm_client.js, core/trai_core.js, public/trai-widget.js (BUG FIX)
  - **maxTokens 300→2500:** DeepSeek reasoning model was getting cut off mid-thought
    - `<think>` blocks alone consumed 1200+ tokens, leaving nothing for actual response
    - Now has room for full reasoning + complete response
  - **Label prefix cleanup:** LLM sometimes outputs "advice:", "response:" prefixes
    - Added regex to strip common prefixes: `/^(advice|response|answer|output|result|reply)[\s:]+/i`
    - Applied in both server (`persistent_llm_client.js`) and client (`trai-widget.js`)
  - **Kraken 24h data:** Added high24h, low24h, open24h to getMarketData() return

### Documentation
- **Comprehensive JSDoc Documentation for Critical Trading Modules** - 9 core files (DOCUMENTATION) - 2026-02-01

    - Asymmetric trade flow is intentional: opens via ExecutionLayer, closes direct to StateManager
  - **Commit:** `4e0dfd0`

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL: WebSocket Never Reconnected (WS_CONNECTED_017)** - kraken_adapter_simple.js (CRITICAL BUG FIX) - 2026-02-04
  - **Root Cause:** `connectWebSocketStream()` never set `this.connected = true`
  - Reconnect logic at line 751 checks `if (this.connected)` - always false!
  - Liveness watchdog triggered "NO DATA FOR 140 SECONDS" but reconnect never happened
  - **Fix:** Added `this.connected = true` in `ws.on('open')` handler
  - **File:** `kraken_adapter_simple.js` lines 569-577
  - **Before:** `this.connected` only set in `connect()` (REST), not `connectWebSocketStream()` (WS)
  - **After:**
    ```javascript
    this.ws.on('open', () => {
      console.log('✅ Kraken WebSocket connected');
      this.connected = true;  // FIX: Now reconnect logic will work
      // ...
    ```
  - **Impact:** WebSocket auto-recovery now actually works
  - **Note:** Fix applied outside pipeline - documented retroactively

- **TradeIntelligenceEngine Now ACTIVE by Default** - run-empire-v2.js (BUG FIX) - 2026-02-04
  - **Root Cause:** Built intelligent exit system to solve $0 P&L problem, left in SHADOW MODE
  - Shadow mode logged decisions but never acted on them
  - **Fix:** Changed default from shadow mode to active mode
  - **File:** `run-empire-v2.js` line 416
  - **Before:** `this.tradeIntelligenceShadowMode = process.env.TRADE_INTELLIGENCE_SHADOW !== 'false';`
  - **After:** `this.tradeIntelligenceShadowMode = process.env.TRADE_INTELLIGENCE_SHADOW === 'true';`
  - **Impact:** Trade intelligence (13-dimension analysis) now actually manages trades

- **CRITICAL: Trading Pause Has No Effect (PAUSE_001)** - run-empire-v2.js (CRITICAL BUG FIX) - 2026-02-04
  - **Root Cause:** `StateManager.pauseTrading()` set `isTrading=false` but nothing checked this flag
  - Bot continued trading with frozen/stale price data while "paused" - 200 trades at $0 P&L
  - **Fix:** Added isTrading check at start of `analyzeAndTrade()` method
  - **File:** `run-empire-v2.js` lines 1458-1464
  - **Before:** No check - analyzeAndTrade ran regardless of pause state
  - **After:**
    ```javascript
    if (stateManager.get('isTrading') === false) {
      const pauseReason = stateManager.get('pauseReason') || 'unknown';
      console.log(`⏸️ Trading paused: ${pauseReason} - skipping analysis`);
      return;
    }
    ```
  - **Impact:** Pause now actually stops trading - no more phantom trades with stale data

- **CRITICAL: AGGRESSIVE_LEARNING_MODE Did Nothing (BRAIN_001)** - run-empire-v2.js (CRITICAL BUG FIX) - 2026-02-04
  - **Root Cause:** TradingBrain rejected trades at 70% threshold BEFORE run-empire could lower to 55%
  - AGGRESSIVE_LEARNING_MODE adjustment happened too late in the pipeline - trades already rejected
  - **Fix:** Set `tradingBrain.config.minConfidenceThreshold` BEFORE calling `getDecision()`
  - **File:** `run-empire-v2.js` lines 1632-1644
  - **Before:** Threshold adjustment after TradingBrain decision (useless)
  - **After:**
    ```javascript
    if (flagManager.isEnabled('AGGRESSIVE_LEARNING_MODE')) {
      const aggressiveThreshold = flagManager.getSetting('AGGRESSIVE_LEARNING_MODE', 'minConfidenceThreshold', 55) / 100;
      if (!this.tradingBrain.config) this.tradingBrain.config = {};
      this.tradingBrain.config.minConfidenceThreshold = aggressiveThreshold;
    }
    ```
  - **Impact:** Pattern learning can now actually happen with 55% confidence trades

- **Backtest Blocked by Stale Data Check (BACKTEST_001)** - run-empire-v2.js (BUG FIX) - 2026-02-04
  - **Root Cause:** Stale data detection treated historical backtest data as "old" and paused
  - All backtest runs spammed "🚨 STALE DATA: 97632544 seconds old" and failed
  - **Fix:** Skip stale data check when `BACKTEST_MODE=true` or `config.enableBacktestMode`
  - **File:** `run-empire-v2.js` lines 1119-1126
  - **Before:** `if (dataAge > 120000) {`
  - **After:**
    ```javascript
    const isBacktesting = process.env.BACKTEST_MODE === 'true' || this.config?.enableBacktestMode;
    if (dataAge > 120000 && !isBacktesting) {
    ```
  - **Impact:** Backtests now complete successfully with historical data
  - **Commit:** `4a828d1`

- **CRITICAL: Pattern Learning Pipeline Broken** - run-empire-v2.js, config/features.json (CRITICAL BUG FIX) - 2026-02-02
  - **Root Cause:** Patterns detected at trade entry were NOT attached to the trade object
  - At trade exit, `buyTrade.patterns` was always empty/undefined
  - Result: 8,176 patterns stored but 0 with outcomes (wins/losses = 0)
  - **Fix:** Pass `patterns` and `entryIndicators` to stateManager.openPosition()
  - **Verification:** Backtest now shows "🧠 Pattern learning: Learning Pattern → 0.06%"
  - **Files:** `run-empire-v2.js` line 2212

- **New Feature: AGGRESSIVE_LEARNING_MODE** - config/features.json (FEATURE) - 2026-02-02
  - Boosts trading activity while pattern bank builds (more trades = faster learning)
  - **Position size:** 2x multiplier (5% → 10%)
  - **Confidence threshold:** 55% (was 70%)
  - **Configurable:** positionSizeMultiplier, minConfidenceThreshold, profitTargetPercent
  - **Toggle:** Set enabled: false in features.json when pattern bank is mature
  - **Commit:** `c01db07`

- **Forensic Audit Fixes - Balance Desync, Dead Code, Debug Cleanup** - Pipeline (BUG FIX + CLEANUP) - 2026-02-01
  - **Balance Desync Prevention:** `core/OptimizedTradingBrain.js` line 822
    - Before: Position sizing used local `this.balance` which could drift from StateManager
    - After: Now syncs from StateManager before calculating max position size
    - Impact: Prevents overtrading when local balance cache is stale
  - **Trend Type Mismatch:** `run-empire-v2.js` lines 1459, 2733
    - Before: Feature arrays stored `trend: 0` (number) when trend was string like 'bullish'
    - After: Converts string trends to numeric: bullish/uptrend=1, bearish/downtrend=-1, else=0
    - Impact: Pattern learning now has consistent numeric features for trend
  - **Dead Code Removal:** ~320 lines removed from `run-empire-v2.js`
    - `calculateAutoDrawLevels()` lines 1742-2016: 275 lines, call was commented out
    - `calculateSimpleIndicators()` + `calculateEMA()` lines 2577-2620: 45 lines, never called
    - These duplicated functionality in OptimizedIndicators.js
  - **Debug Logging Cleanup:** `core/OptimizedIndicators.js`
    - Removed 9 verbose console.logs in RSI, MACD, EMA, Bollinger calculations
    - These were debug aids that cluttered production logs
  - **Commit:** `55d87fd`

- **CATASTROPHIC P&L CALCULATION BUG - Bot Lost $99.99 Per Trade** - core/StateManager.js (CRITICAL BUG FIX) - 2026-02-01
  - **ROOT CAUSE OF $10K→$0 THREE TIMES:** Position stored in BTC, but closePosition() treated it as USD
  - Bot would spend $100 to buy 0.001 BTC, but on close only add back $0.001 instead of $101
  - **Example of the bug:**
    - OPEN: 0.001 BTC at $100,000 → balance = $10,000 - $100 = $9,900 ✓
    - CLOSE at $101,000 (1% profit):
      - OLD (broken): `pnl = 0.001 * 0.01 = $0.00001` ← treating 0.001 BTC as $0.001 USD!
      - OLD (broken): `balance = $9,900 + 0.001 + 0.00001 = $9,900.001` ← lost $99.999!
      - NEW (fixed): `pnl = 0.001 * ($101,000 - $100,000) = $1.00`
      - NEW (fixed): `balance = $9,900 + (0.001 * $101,000) = $10,001` ✓
  - **Bug 1:** `core/StateManager.js` line 227 - P&L calculation wrong
    - Before: `const pnl = closeSize * priceChangePercent;  // Dollar position × price change %`
    - After: `const pnl = closeSize * (price - this.state.entryPrice);  // BTC × price diff = USD profit`
  - **Bug 2:** `core/StateManager.js` line 249 - Balance added BTC, not USD
    - Before: `balance: this.state.balance + closeSize + pnl,`
    - After: `balance: this.state.balance + usdValueReturned,  // closeSize * price`
  - **Bug 3:** `core/StateManager.js` lines 205, 263 - inPosition tracking was in BTC not USD
    - Before: `inPosition: this.state.inPosition + size,` (adding BTC)
    - After: `inPosition: this.state.inPosition + usdCost,` (adding USD)
  - **Impact:** Bot could have had 100% winning trades and STILL gone to $0
  - **Why realizedPnL showed ~$0 but balance showed $57:** P&L was calculated as tiny BTC amounts
  - **State reset to $10,000** - Fresh start with correct math

- **Exit Logic Safety Nets Bypassed When MaxProfitManager Active** - run-empire-v2.js (CRITICAL BUG FIX) - 2026-02-01
  - **Root Cause:** Stop loss and 30-minute escape were inside `if (!maxProfitManager.active)` block
  - When MaxProfitManager WAS active but not triggering exits, safety nets were SKIPPED
  - Bot would hold positions indefinitely with no escape path
  - **Fix:** Moved hard stop loss (-1.5%) and 30-minute timeout OUTSIDE the conditional
  - These safety exits now ALWAYS run regardless of MaxProfitManager state
  - **File:** `run-empire-v2.js` lines 2166-2198

- **Double Trade Markers on Dashboard** - public/unified-dashboard.html (BUG FIX) - 2026-02-01
  - Trade markers showing twice (BUY BUY, SELL SELL) on chart
  - Two handlers were calling `plotTradeSignal()`: one for `trade` type, one for `trade_opened`
  - Both triggered for same trade from different code paths
  - **Fix:** Disabled duplicate `trade_opened` handler at line 3682

- **Pattern Learning Pipeline Completely Broken** - run-empire-v2.js, core/RiskManager.js (CRITICAL BUG FIX) - 2026-02-01
  - **Root Cause:** 8,176 patterns recorded with wins=0, losses=0, totalPnL=0 - bot never learned ANYTHING
  - **Bug 1:** `run-empire-v2.js` line 2403 - patterns stored WITHOUT `features` array
    - Before: `patterns: patterns?.map(p => ({ name, signature, confidence }))`
    - After: `patterns: patterns?.map(p => ({ name, signature, confidence, features: p.features || [] }))`
    - Impact: Trade close couldn't find original pattern to update with P&L
  - **Bug 2:** `run-empire-v2.js` line 1467 - entry recording created pnl=0 patterns
    - Before: `this.patternChecker.recordPatternResult(features, { detected: true, ... })` (no pnl field!)
    - After: DISABLED - patterns only recorded at trade EXIT with actual P&L
    - Impact: 8,176 useless patterns polluting memory
  - **Bug 3:** `core/RiskManager.js` line 1794 - fallback to signature string crashed recordPatternResult
    - Before: `const featuresForRecording = pattern.features || pattern.signature`
    - After: Skip recording if features not available (with warning log)
    - Impact: "Expected features array, got string" errors
  - **Action:** Pattern memory reset (backup saved), fresh start with proper recording

- **TRAI Chat Returning JSON Instead of Text** - trai_brain/prompt_schemas.js, trai_brain/trai_core.js (BUG FIX)
  - Root cause: ALL queries got prompt "You must respond in strict JSON"
  - LLM was obeying the instruction and returning JSON blobs in chat
  - Added `chat` schema type for conversational responses (no JSON required)
  - Changed `chooseSchema()` to default to chat mode for normal queries
  - Only use structured JSON for explicit planning keywords (plan, proposal, strategy)
  - Built conversational prompt for chat: natural language, not JSON schema
  - Result: TRAI chat now responds in plain English, not JSON

- **V2 Architecture: Remove BrokerFactory Bypass** - run-empire-v2.js (ARCHITECTURE)
  - AI assistants had added fallback that created KrakenAdapterSimple directly
  - This violated V2 architecture where BrokerFactory is SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH
  - Removed the fallback - if BrokerFactory fails, bot fails (no silent bypasses)
  - Future brokers (Coinbase, Alpaca, etc.) will ALL go through BrokerFactory
  - Data flow: Market → Broker Adapter → BrokerFactory → Bot → Dashboard

- **TRAI Chat Response Extraction** - run-empire-v2.js (BUG FIX)
  - TRAI responses showed garbage because wrong property was extracted
  - TRAI Core returns LLM output in `response.response`, not `response.message`
  - Fixed extraction order: `response.response || response.message || response.text`
  - Also added leading garbage cleanup and incomplete sentence truncation

- **TRAI Chat Leaking Thinking Tags** - core/persistent_llm_client.js (BUG FIX)
  - TRAI responses showed raw `<think>...</think>` tags from DeepSeek model
  - Original regex only cleaned complete tag pairs, not incomplete/orphaned tags
  - Added cleanup for: incomplete `<think>` blocks, orphan `</think>`, garbage tokens
  - Added fallback response if empty after cleaning
  - TRAI chat now returns clean, readable responses

- **Dashboard Trade Log Cutoff** - public/unified-dashboard.html (UI/UX)
  - Trade log was getting cut off at bottom of page
  - Increased max-height from 200px to 400px
  - Added `overflow-y: auto` to body to enable page scrolling

- **Dashboard WebSocket Silent Death** - run-empire-v2.js (STABILITY)
  - Root cause: WebSocket dying silently with no close event, reconnection never triggered
  - Symptom: Dashboard showed no chart, required manual bot restart
  - Reduced ping interval from 30s to 15s (faster stale detection)
  - Reduced pong timeout from 45s to 30s (miss 2 pings = dead)
  - Added data watchdog: force reconnect if no messages for 60s
  - Reduced reconnect delay from 5s to 2s (faster recovery)
  - Track `lastDashboardMessageReceived` for accurate watchdog

- **Misleading LONG/SHORT Labels on SPOT Market** - run-empire-v2.js (ACCURACY)
  - On SPOT crypto, you can only BUY coins or SELL coins you own
  - Bot was displaying "SHORT" when selling, implying margin shorting
  - Added `getDirectionDisplayLabel()` helper to detect market type
  - SPOT crypto now displays BUY/SELL (accurate for spot trading)
  - Options/Futures will display LONG/SHORT (accurate for derivatives)
  - Updated comments to clarify SPOT market limitations

- **Dashboard Multi-Timeframe Support** - kraken_adapter_simple.js, run-empire-v2.js (BUG FIX)
  - All timeframes now display correct candle intervals (1m, 5m, 15m, 30m, 1h, 4h, 1d)
  - Added multi-timeframe OHLC subscription to Kraken WebSocket (real-time updates)
  - Added `getHistoricalOHLC()` REST API call for historical candle data
  - Fixed missing 4H timeframe (240 interval was not subscribed)
  - Timeframe changes now fetch actual historical data from Kraken REST API
  - WebSocket provides real-time updates, REST API provides history
  - 1D/4H timeframes now show proper historical bars, not just current day

- **Dashboard Indicators from Historical Data** - public/unified-dashboard.html (BUG FIX)
  - Indicators (EMA, BB, VWAP) now calculated from historical candles
  - Added client-side calculateEMA(), calculateBollingerBands(), calculateVWAP()
  - Indicator lines are now smooth curves, not stepped/jagged
  - All indicator series populated with setData() on historical load

- **Dashboard Crosshair Timezone** - public/unified-dashboard.html (BUG FIX)
  - Crosshair now shows local time instead of UTC
  - Added `timeToLocal()` converter per Lightweight Charts docs
  - All chart timestamps (candles, indicators, trade markers) display in user's timezone

- **Start Script .env Parsing** - start-ogzprime.sh (BUG FIX)
  - Fixed parsing of .env files with inline comments
  - Uses sed to strip comments before export

### Changed
- **Dashboard Theme Customization System** - public/unified-dashboard.html (UI/UX)
  - Added 5 color theme presets: Default, Ocean, Sunset, Royal, Hacker
  - applyTheme() function updates CSS variables for full theme switching
  - updateAccentColor() allows custom accent color selection
  - updateFont() supports font family customization
  - Theme preferences saved to localStorage for persistence across sessions
  - Top-right color palette now fully functional for customer customization

- **Dashboard Chain of Thought Redesign** - public/unified-dashboard.html (UI/UX)
  - Increased max-height from 150px to 250px for better visibility
  - Added gradient backgrounds (black to dark blue tones)
  - Enhanced decision badges with glowing effects (BUY=green glow, SELL=red glow, HOLD=gold glow)
  - Rounded corners and box shadows for modern card appearance
  - Decision type prominently displayed with color-coded badge
  - Improved readability with better padding and spacing

- **Dashboard Pattern SVG Visualizations** - public/unified-dashboard.html (UI/UX)
  - Added SVG visual representations for 17 chart patterns
  - Pattern Analysis box now shows graphical pattern diagram (not just text)
  - Patterns include: double bottom/top, triangles, engulfing, hammer, H&S, flags, etc.
  - Trade log now shows BUY/SELL (not LONG/SHORT) for spot trading consistency
  - Right panel font sizes increased from 10-11px to 12-13px for readability
  - Enhanced pattern visual container with background and border styling

- **Dashboard Overhaul for Proof Display** - public/unified-dashboard.html (UI/UX)
  - Hidden Neural Ensemble Voting section via CSS
  - Enhanced Pattern Panel with educational descriptions
    - Added 17 pattern definitions with emoji, name, and plain-English explanations
    - Patterns now display educational content when detected
  - Improved Trade Log styling
    - Grid layout with BUY/SELL, value, and timestamp columns
    - Color-coded left border (green for BUY, red for SELL)
    - BUY trades show entry price, SELL trades show P&L
    - Cleaner, more readable layout

### Fixed
- **TRAI Chain of Thought Not Updating** - run-empire-v2.js (BUG FIX)
  - Root cause: Bot sent `type: 'trai_reasoning'` but dashboard only handled `type: 'bot_thinking'`
  - Changed message type to 'bot_thinking' to match dashboard handler
  - Added decisionContext to HOLD returns for continuous updates
  - Restructured payload to match dashboard expectations (message, data.rsi, data.trend, etc.)
  - Chain of Thought now updates on every trading cycle, not just on trades

### Added
- **Real-time Proof Publishing** - ogz-meta/claudito-logger.js (TRANSPARENCY)
  - publishLiveProof() auto-updates `public/proof/live-trades.json` after every trade
  - Shows last 20 trades with prices, reasons, confidence
  - Includes stats: total trades, 24h activity, symbols traded
  - Accessible at https://ogzprime.com/proof/live-trades.json
  - Fails silently to avoid crashing bot

### Removed
- **Redundant Dashboard Server (port 3008)** - dashboard-server.js (ARCHITECTURE)
  - Decommissioned duplicate WebSocket relay server
  - Was running alongside ogz-websocket (port 3010) causing confusion
  - All traffic now consolidated through ogz-websocket per V2 architecture
  - File renamed to .DECOMMISSIONED to prevent accidental launch
  - start-ogzprime.sh updated to remove references
  - PM2 process deleted and saved

### Added
- **Candle History Persistence** - run-empire-v2.js (RELIABILITY)
  - Saves priceHistory to `data/candle-history.json` every 5 new candles
  - Loads candles from disk on startup (filtered to last 4 hours)
  - Prevents fat bars on dashboard after restart
  - Max 200 candles persisted (matches existing trim logic)

- **WebSocket Heartbeat** - run-empire-v2.js (RELIABILITY)
  - Bot sends ping every 30s to dashboard-server
  - Server responds with pong (already existed at dashboard-server.js:96-97)
  - Tracks lastPongReceived timestamp
  - Forces reconnect if no pong within 45s timeout
  - Prevents stale connections showing empty dashboard
  - Clears interval on close to prevent memory leaks

- **Collapsible Side Panel Layout** - public/unified-dashboard.html (UI/UX)
  - Trade Manager panel moved to West (left side)
  - Edge Analytics panel moved to East (right side)
  - Chart fills space between panels with auto-resize on collapse
  - Click headers to collapse - chart smoothly expands into freed space
  - "Click to collapse" hints on panel headers
  - Removed ML/CORE flashing badges (clutter)
  - Indicator overlay repositioned to top-left corner
  - Tighter spacing, darker theme, sharper edges
  - Chart height now viewport-relative for better screen utilization

- **Unified FeatureFlagManager** - core/FeatureFlagManager.js (ARCHITECTURE)
  - Problem: Two independent feature flag systems (features.json + TierFeatureFlags.js) didn't communicate
  - User observed feature flags not being respected multiple times
  - Solution: Created FeatureFlagManager singleton as single source of truth
  - TierFeatureFlags.js now delegates to FeatureFlagManager
  - All backtest/trading modules updated to use FeatureFlagManager
  - Mode-aware (paper/live/backtest) with proper env var detection

### Removed
- **Dead npm packages** - package.json (CLEANUP)
  - Removed `@anthropic-ai/sdk` - 0 uses found in codebase
  - Removed `require-in-the-middle` - 0 uses found in codebase
  - Dependencies reduced from 12 to 10

- **Dead/duplicate files** - root + foundation/ (CLEANUP)
  - `TierFeatureFlags2.js` - 0 imports (dead)
  - `tradeLogger.js` (root) - duplicate of core/tradeLogger.js
  - `trai_core.js` (root) - duplicate of core/trai_core.js
  - `BrokerFactory.js` (root) - 0 imports (dead)
  - `IBrokerAdapter.js` (root) - 0 imports (dead)
  - `index.js` - broken imports to non-existent directories
  - `foundation/BrokerFactory.js` - 0 imports (dead)
  - `foundation/AssetConfigManager.js` - 0 imports (dead)
  - Kept: `foundation/IBrokerAdapter.js` (8 broker adapters depend on it)

- **BacktestEngine.js** - backtest/BacktestEngine.js (CLEANUP)
  - Dead code with divergent signal logic (didn't match production)
  - Didn't set BACKTEST_MODE (contamination risk)
  - Real backtests use `BACKTEST_MODE=true node run-empire-v2.js`
  - Same codebase for live/paper/backtest ensures consistency

### Verified
- **Pattern Memory Separation** - Forensics audit (VALIDATION)
  - PatternMemoryBank mode-aware partitioning: ✅ WORKING
  - paper=8176 patterns, live=empty, backtest=empty (proper isolation)
  - StateManager has BACKTEST_MODE guards on load() and save()
  - Feature flag PATTERN_MEMORY_PARTITION properly configured

### Reverted
- **Dashboard Indicator Overlays** - public/unified-dashboard.html (STABILITY)
  - Problem: Added 200+ lines for 8 indicator overlays without smoke testing
  - Result: Fat bars (insufficient candles), broken TRAI widget
  - Solution: Reverted to commit 6308df0 (last known working state)
  - Lesson: Pipeline enforcement is mandatory - smoke test before commit

### Fixed
- **Memory Leak: ALL Interval Leaks** - 6 files (MEMORY FIX)
  - run-empire-v2.js: heartbeatInterval cleared in shutdown()
  - TimeFrameManager.js: cacheCleanupInterval, volatilityCheckInterval, autoOptimizationInterval
  - PerformanceDashboardIntegration.js: realTimeUpdateInterval + added shutdown()
  - SingletonLock.js: lockMonitorInterval cleared in releaseLock()
  - KrakenAdapterV2.js: accountPollingInterval cleared in unsubscribeAll()
  - trai_core.js: analysisInterval, monitoringInterval cleared in shutdown()
  - Every setInterval now has corresponding clearInterval on cleanup

- **TRAI calculateRelevance slice error** - core/trai_core.js (STABILITY FIX)
  - Problem: "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'slice')"
  - Solution: Added defensive guard for typeof slice === 'function'
  - Added optional chaining for query.toLowerCase()

- **invariants.js ESM/CommonJS Conflict** - core/invariants.js (STARTUP FIX)
  - Problem: Mixed `export function` (ESM) with `module.exports` (CommonJS)
  - Caused "module is not defined in ES module scope" error on every startup
  - Solution: Convert to pure CommonJS (function declarations + module.exports)

- **WebSocket 502 Errors on Startup** - start-ogzprime.sh (STARTUP FIX)
  - Problem: Bot got 502 errors connecting to wss://ogzprime.com/ws after restart
  - Root cause: pm2 returns before server ready + nginx caches stale upstream state
  - Solution: Added wait_for_port() to poll localhost:3010 until ready
  - Solution: Added nginx reload after websocket server starts
  - Startup now waits for websocket, reloads nginx, then starts bot

- **Dashboard Candles Not Loading** - dashboard-server.js (DASHBOARD FIX)
  - Problem: Chart showed empty/fat bars on page refresh
  - Root cause: `type: 'price'` messages not forwarded (contained candles array)
  - Server only handled: ping, bot_status, trade_signal, trai_*, trade, bot_thinking, pattern_analysis
  - Solution: Added price message handler to forward candles to dashboard
  - 4 lines changed, follows existing message handler pattern

- **CRITICAL: Broken Symlink Crash** - utils/tradeLogger.js (PRODUCTION FIX)
  - Problem: Bot crashed with "OptimizedTradingBrain is not a constructor"
  - Root cause: utils/tradeLogger.js symlink pointed to deleted root/tradeLogger.js
  - Previous cleanup deleted root tradeLogger.js without checking for symlinks
  - Solution: Updated symlink to point to core/tradeLogger.js
  - Lesson: Validator must include smoke test before commit

- **Dashboard Message Forwarding** - dashboard-server.js (DASHBOARD FIX)
  - Problem: Trade P&L showing $0.00, Chain of Thought stuck, no chart markers
  - Root cause: dashboard-server.js only forwarded 5 message types, dropped others
  - Solution: Added handlers for `trade`, `bot_thinking`, `pattern_analysis`
  - All dashboard features should now receive data from bot

- **Trade Log Not Receiving Live Trades** - run-empire-v2.js (DASHBOARD FIX)
  - Bug: Dashboard trade log never showed new BUY/SELL trades
  - Bot recorded trades internally but never broadcast to WebSocket clients
  - Dashboard expected `type: 'trade'` messages with action, price, pnl, timestamp
  - Fix: Added WebSocket broadcast after BUY execution (line 2165)
  - Fix: Added WebSocket broadcast after SELL execution (line 2287)
  - Trade log now updates in real-time with executed trades

- **SELL Trades Accumulating in activeTrades** - run-empire-v2.js + StateManager.js (CRITICAL BUG)
  - Bug: `updateActiveTrade()` was called for ALL trades (BUY and SELL) at line 2071
  - SELL trades were added to `activeTrades` but never removed
  - `closePosition()` only removed trades where `type === 'BUY'`, not `action === 'SELL'`
  - Result: 96 SELL "positions" accumulated, destroying 90% of paper balance ($9k loss)
  - Fix 1: Only call `updateActiveTrade()` for BUY trades (run-empire-v2.js:2069)
  - Fix 2: `closePosition()` now clears ALL trades on full close (StateManager.js:234)
  - Defense in depth: Both fixes prevent this class of bug from recurring

- **P&L Calculation Ignoring Open Position** - run-empire-v2.js:924 (DISPLAY BUG)
  - Bug: `totalPnL = balance - 10000` didn't include value of open position
  - If $250 was in a BTC position, dashboard showed -$250 P&L (wrong!)
  - Fix: `totalPnL = (balance + positionValue) - 10000`
  - Now correctly shows actual account value change

- **No Fresh Start Option for Paper Trading** - StateManager.js (ARCHITECTURE)
  - Problem: Paper trading loaded stale state (old balances, trade counts)
  - Required manual reset scripts - treating symptoms not causes
  - Fix: Added `FRESH_START=true` env var to reset state on boot
  - Paper trading can now reliably start clean without manual intervention

- **Cursor Bleeding to Whole Page** - public/unified-dashboard.html (UX FIX)
  - Bug: TradingView crosshair cursor showed across entire page, not just chart
  - Made cursor hard to see and navigation confusing
  - Fix: Added `cursor: default` to body element
  - Fix: Added `cursor: crosshair` only to `#tvChartContainer`
  - Crosshair now shows only when hovering over the chart

- **BOT Status Light Not Turning Green** - public/unified-dashboard.html (UX FIX)
  - Bug: BOT status light stayed grey even when receiving live data
  - Only turned green on `trade` or `bot_status` messages
  - Since price data comes from the bot, should indicate bot is alive
  - Fix: Now updates BOT light when price data is received (line 3153)

- **TRAI Status Light Not Turning Green** - public/trai-widget.js (UX FIX)
  - Bug: TRAI light only turned green on `bot_thinking` WebSocket messages
  - After switching widget to HTTP calls, WebSocket never received messages
  - Fix: Widget now directly updates `traiLight` on successful Ollama response
  - Fix: Exposed `window.statusTimestamps` for widget to update timestamps

- **Candlestick Width Too Fat** - public/unified-dashboard.html (UX FIX)
  - Bug: Default TradingView barSpacing made candles too wide/fat
  - Fix: Added `barSpacing: 8, minBarSpacing: 2, rightOffset: 5` to timeScale
  - Candles now proportioned correctly for readability

- **TRAI Widget Timeout** - trai-widget.js + ogzprime-ssl-server.js (INTEGRATION FIX)
  - Bug: Widget sent `trai_query` via WebSocket but relay had no Ollama handler
  - TRAI would show "Thinking..." forever then timeout
  - Fix: Changed widget to call Ollama directly via HTTP `/api/ollama/chat`
  - Fix: Added Ollama proxy endpoint to SSL server (POST /api/ollama/chat)

- **Performance Stats Not Updating** - run-empire-v2.js + unified-dashboard.html (UX FIX)
  - Bug: Dashboard showed $0.00 P&L and 0% Win Rate even during live trading
  - Bot was sending balance but not calculated PnL or win rate
  - Fix: Bot now calculates and sends totalPnL (balance - initial) and winRate
  - Fix: Dashboard extracts these from price messages and updates display

- **API Routes Going to Dead Port** - nginx config (ARCHITECTURE FIX)
  - Bug: nginx `/api/` location routed to port 3008, but nothing runs there
  - All API calls failed silently - TRAI widget, any future endpoints
  - Root cause: Config was outdated, port 3010 is the unified server
  - Fix: Changed `/api/` proxy_pass from `localhost:3008` to `localhost:3010/api/`
  - Also added specific `/api/ollama/` route with 5-minute timeout for LLM inference
  - Architecture now correct: all traffic through unified port 3010

- **Kraken Silent Failure / Data Feed Going Dark** - kraken_adapter_simple.js (STABILITY CRITICAL)
  - Bug: WebSocket stayed "open" (TCP keepalive worked) but Kraken stopped sending data
  - Ping/pong heartbeat kept TCP alive but didn't detect application-layer data loss
  - Symptom: Liveness watchdog fires "NO DATA FOR 145 SECONDS" but no reconnect
  - Fix: Added data-level watchdog that tracks `lastDataReceived` timestamp
  - If no actual market data for 60 seconds, force `ws.terminate()` to trigger reconnect
  - This catches silent failures where socket appears open but data stopped flowing

### Added
- **Local TRAI LLM with Ollama** - /opt/ogzprime/models/ (FEATURE)
  - Installed Ollama for local LLM inference
  - Downloaded Qwen3-14B-RefusalDirection-ThinkingAware (Q6_K, 12.2GB GGUF)
  - Created Modelfile with TRAI system prompt for trading advice
  - Imported as `trai:latest` model
  - Runs on A100 GPU for fast inference (~2-3 seconds)

- **Liveness Watchdog Interval Leak** - run-empire-v2.js:2754-2758 (MEMORY FIX)
  - Bug: `livenessCheckInterval` was never cleared on shutdown
  - While `tradingInterval` was properly cleared, the liveness watchdog kept running
  - Fix: Added `clearInterval(this.livenessCheckInterval)` to shutdown() method
  - Prevents orphan interval from continuing after bot shutdown

- **Pattern Save Spam** - core/EnhancedPatternRecognition.js:897 (I/O FIX)
  - Bug: `recordPatternResult()` called `saveToDisk()` on EVERY pattern record
  - With 15-second trading interval, this caused excessive disk I/O
  - Fix: Removed aggressive `saveToDisk()` call from recordPatternResult
  - Pattern memory still saves via 5-minute periodic auto-save (line 234-236)
  - Cleanup on shutdown still saves (cleanup() method preserved)

- **Proof Page Stale Data** - public/proof/index.html (UX FIX)
  - Bug: Gate verification page showed static data from January 15
  - Made it look "placeholder-ish" and unprofessional
  - Fix: Added live data fetching from `/api/health` endpoint
  - Now shows real-time uptime, memory usage, and live status indicators
  - Falls back to static JSON if bot API unavailable
  - Refresh interval reduced from 5 minutes to 30 seconds

- **Kraken WebSocket Heartbeat Missing** - kraken_adapter_simple.js (STABILITY CRITICAL)
  - Bug: No ping/pong mechanism to keep Kraken connection alive
  - Kraken closes idle connections after ~60 seconds without heartbeat
  - Symptom: Frequent disconnects, "data feed going dark" repeatedly
  - Fix: Added `ws.on('ping')` handler to respond to server pings
  - Fix: Added client-side ping interval (every 30 seconds)
  - Fix: Track `lastPong` timestamp for connection health monitoring
  - Clean up ping interval on disconnect and close

- **Reconnect Gives Up After 10 Attempts** - kraken_adapter_simple.js (STABILITY CRITICAL)
  - Bug: After 10 failed reconnect attempts, adapter stopped trying forever
  - Bot would stay dead until manual restart
  - This contradicts our stability promise - bot must stay connected
  - Fix: Reconnect now tries FOREVER with exponential backoff
  - Backoff caps at 5 minutes (was 60 seconds)
  - Warnings at 10 and 50 attempts, but never stops trying
  - Only stops if `this.connected = false` (intentional disconnect)

- **Dashboard currentPrice.toFixed Crash** - public/unified-dashboard.html (DASHBOARD CRITICAL)
  - Bug: Code referenced `currentPrice` as a variable but it was never declared
  - Only `lastPrice` variable existed for price tracking
  - Caused `Uncaught TypeError: currentPrice.toFixed is not a function` spam (every second)
  - Broke: Calculator auto-fill, liquidation heatmap, whale alerts, edge analytics
  - Fix: Changed all `currentPrice` variable references to use `lastPrice`
  - Fix: Added type safety check in `drawLiquidationHeatmap()` function

- **TRAI Widget 403 Forbidden** - public/trai-widget.js (PERMISSION FIX)
  - Bug: File permissions were `-rw-------` (owner-only read/write)
  - Web server couldn't read the file to serve it
  - Broke: TRAI chain-of-thought floating display
  - Fix: Changed permissions to `-rw-r--r--` (world-readable)

- **TRAI Widget WebSocket URL** - public/trai-widget.js (CONNECTION FIX)
  - Bug: Widget connected to `wss://ogzprime.com/` instead of `wss://ogzprime.com/ws`
  - Caused constant reconnect failures in console
  - Fix: Added `/ws` path to WebSocket URL

- **TRAI Inference Server Missing** - core/ symlinks (CRITICAL FIX)
  - Bug: inference_server.py files were in `trai_brain/` but code looked in `core/`
  - Error: `python3: can't open file '/opt/ogzprime/OGZPMLV2/core/inference_server.py'`
  - TRAI fell back to rule-based reasoning with no LLM
  - Fix: Created symlinks from `core/` to `trai_brain/` for all inference servers

- **TRAI Running on CPU Instead of GPU** - trai_brain/inference_server_ct.py (PERFORMANCE CRITICAL)
  - Bug: `gpu_layers=0` meant entire 7B model ran on CPU
  - A100 GPU with 20GB VRAM sat completely idle
  - Inference took 10-15+ seconds (why TRAI was removed from hot path)
  - Fix: Changed to `gpu_layers=50` to load all layers to GPU
  - Also increased context_length from 2048 to 4096
  - Now sub-second inference - TRAI can return to hot path

- **Dashboard Chart Time/Zoom Issues** - public/unified-dashboard.html (UX FIX)
  - Bug: Chart displayed times in UTC instead of local timezone
  - Bug: Chart was too zoomed out, candles had no detail
  - Bug: Scroll wheel zoom was disabled
  - Fix: Added `timeFormatter` to convert Unix timestamps to local time
  - Fix: Enabled scroll wheel zoom for better chart navigation
  - Fix: Added auto-fit to show last 50 candles on data load

### Changed
- **Gate Proof JSON Updated** - ogz-meta/gates/runs/latest.json
  - Updated with current commit (70995f3) and timestamp
  - Added Gate 5 (Truth Source) and Gate 6 (Risk Management)
  - More descriptive highlights for each gate verification

- **Dashboard Responsive Layout** - public/unified-dashboard.html (UI FIX)
  - Fixed overlapping fixed elements on right side (tier-selector vs theme-customizer)
  - Fixed overlapping fixed elements on left side (bot-status-row vs indicator-overlay)
  - Added comprehensive responsive media queries for ALL fixed panels
  - Breakpoints: 1024px (tablet landscape), 768px (tablet portrait), 480px (mobile), landscape
  - Panels now auto-adapt to device size: collapse, reposition, or convert to bottom-sheets
  - Mobile: Tier-selector hidden, panels use full-width bottom-sheet approach

### Changed
- **Dashboard File Renamed** - public/unified-dashboard.html (BREAKING)
  - Renamed `unified-dashboard-refactor.html` → `unified-dashboard.html`
  - Updated all references in: launch-empire-v2.sh, dashboard-server.js, SYSTEM-ARCHITECTURE-PACKET.md, ogz-modules-list.txt
  - index.html and pricing.html were already linking to `unified-dashboard.html` (now works)
  - **URL**: https://ogzprime.com/unified-dashboard.html

### Added
- **Liveness Watchdog** - run-empire-v2.js:978-1006 (CRITICAL FIX)
  - Detected: Bot ran on 3-day stale data ($90k vs $95k reality) with no alerts
  - Root cause: Existing stale detection only triggers when data ARRIVES
  - If broker stops emitting events entirely, nothing detected it
  - Fix: Added `startLivenessWatchdog()` - periodic check every 60s
  - If no data received for 2 minutes, pauses trading and logs loudly
  - Tracks `this.lastDataReceived` timestamp, updated in `handleMarketData()`
  - This catches "feed went completely dark" scenario

- **WebSocket Reconnect Counter Reset** - kraken_adapter_simple.js:471-476 (BUG FIX)
  - Bug: `reconnectAttempts` counter never reset after successful reconnection
  - Result: Counter accumulated across multiple disconnects over days/weeks
  - Eventually hit `maxReconnectAttempts` (10) and gave up permanently
  - Fix: Reset `reconnectAttempts = 0` in `ws.on('open')` handler
  - Now each disconnect cycle starts fresh with 10 attempts

### Changed
- **TRAI Local-First Architecture** - trai_brain/
  - Complete architectural shift to local-first mode (no cloud LLM/embeddings by default)
  - **trai_core.js**: Removed cloud fallback, added `getOfflineResponse()` for clear offline status
  - If local LLM server not running, returns explicit TRAI_OFFLINE status (no silent degradation)
  - No paid API calls unless explicitly enabled

- **TRAI Memory Store Rewrite** - trai_brain/memory_store.js
  - Removed ALL embedding/vector code (no OpenAI, no cloud calls)
  - Changed to append-only JSONL journal (`trai_journal.jsonl`)
  - Keyword + recency retrieval (70% keyword match, 30% recency decay)
  - 7-day half-life exponential decay for recency scoring
  - New methods: `recordInteraction()`, `recordDecision()`, `recordMistake()`, `recordOutcome()`
  - No external dependencies (no node-fetch, no embeddings)

- **Inference Server Embedding Disabled** - trai_brain/inference_server.py
  - Embedding server disabled by default (local-first mode)
  - Set `TRAI_ENABLE_EMBEDDINGS=1` to enable if needed
  - bge-small-en-v1.5 via sentence-transformers (when enabled)

### Added
- **MAExtensionFilter** - core/MAExtensionFilter.js (NEW)
  - 20MA Extension + Acceleration + First-Touch Skip filter
  - Tracks how far/fast price moves away from 20MA (in ATR units)
  - After "accelerating away" event, skips first touch back to MA (often fake-out)
  - Allows second touch or resets after timeout (20 bars default)
  - Feature flag: `MA_EXTENSION_FILTER` in config/features.json (disabled by default)
  - Verified against 60k candles: 13 accelerations, 8 first-touch skips, 8 second-touch allows
  - Verification test: test/verify-ma-extension-filter.js

- **TRAI Research Mode** - trai_brain/research_mode.js (NEW)
  - External web search capability (OFF by default)
  - Enable with `TRAI_RESEARCH_ENABLED=1`
  - SearXNG self-hosted search endpoint (http://localhost:8888/search)
  - Strict rate limits: 3 queries/minute, 50 queries/day
  - Per-user daily budget tracking
  - NO cloud LLM - search only, summarization via local LLM

- **TRAI Prompt Schemas** - trai_brain/prompt_schemas.js (NEW)
  - Structured output schemas for mission/proposal JSON
  - `chooseSchema(query)` function for dynamic schema selection

- **TRAI Read-Only Tools** - trai_brain/read_only_tools.js (NEW)
  - ReadOnlyToolbox class with safe operations
  - Methods: `repo_search()`, `file_open()`, `log_tail()`, `bot_status()`
  - Bounds checking to prevent access outside repo root

### Removed
- **PreviousDayRangeStrategy** - run-empire-v2.js
  - Removed broken PDR strategy (lines 1065-1107, 1204-1239)
  - Strategy was using wrong candle property names: `c.high/c.low/c.close` instead of `c.h/c.l/c.c`
  - Import, initialization, update block, override block, and confluence logic all removed
  - TPO override logic retained (working correctly)
  - Will be re-implemented when user provides correct math/specs
  - Files affected:
    - `run-empire-v2.js`: Removed ~80 lines of broken PDR code
    - `core/PreviousDayRangeStrategy.js`: File exists but no longer imported

### Fixed
- **SELL signals blocked by 1500% threshold** - run-empire-v2.js:203-208
  - Bug: `minConfidenceThreshold` received raw `15` instead of `0.15`
  - Result: "Direction determination skipped: 54.0% below threshold 1500.0%"
  - ALL sell signals were being blocked (impossible threshold)
  - Fix: Added same percentage conversion as `minTradeConfidence`
  - **Before:** `MIN_TRADE_CONFIDENCE=15` → `15.0` (1500%)
  - **After:** `MIN_TRADE_CONFIDENCE=15` → `0.15` (15%)
  - Verified via signal test harness (4/4 scenarios pass)

- **Silent killer: resumeTrading() never called** - run-empire-v2.js:774
  - Added `stateManager.resumeTrading()` when fresh data restored
  - Without this, bot permanently paused after any stale feed event
  - **Before:** Bot would pause on stale data, never resume
  - **After:** Bot resumes trading when feed recovers

- **Discord .toFixed on undefined** - utils/discordNotifier.js:205
  - Fixed `pnl.toFixed(2)` crash when pnl is null/undefined
  - Added proper type check: `typeof pnl === 'number' && !isNaN(pnl)`

- **Stale data detection rewrite** - run-empire-v2.js:747-775
  - Changed from tracking "last data arrival time" to checking "data age via etime"
  - Uses exchange timestamp (`etime`) to detect truly stale data
  - Threshold: 2 minutes (data older than 2min = stale)
  - Properly calls resumeTrading() on recovery

- **TRAI chat query routing** - run-empire-v2.js:2624-2628
  - Bot was calling `this.trai.processQuery()` but method doesn't exist on TRAIDecisionModule
  - TRAIDecisionModule = trading decisions (`processDecision`)
  - TRAICore = chat/queries (`processQuery`)
  - **Before:** `this.trai.processQuery()` → crash (method undefined)
  - **After:** `this.trai.traiCore.processQuery()` → correct routing
  - Added null check for when LLM inference server not running

### Added
- **Signal Test Harness** - test/signal-test-harness.js
  - Tests specific patterns trigger expected trades
  - Scenarios: Bullish engulfing, Hammer, TPO buy, TPO sell
  - Usage: `node test/signal-test-harness.js --all`
  - Validates bot logic without corrupting production state
  - Backtest mode now skips singleton lock and state loading

- **TEST_MODE** - run-empire-v2.js:412-428
  - New mode for testing signals without corrupting pattern base
  - Set `TEST_MODE=true` to enable
  - Patterns still used for decisions but NOT saved
  - Optional `TEST_CONFIDENCE=75` to inject fake confidence
  - Protects pattern base during development/debugging

## [2.7.0] - 2025-01-02

### Fixed
- **Kill Switch (Non-Throwing)** - core/AdvancedExecutionLayer-439-MERGED.js:133-147
  - Uncommented and fixed kill switch to skip trades without throwing
  - Returns `{success: false, blocked: true}` instead of crashing bot
  - Added throttled logging (every 5 seconds) to prevent log spam
  - Bot continues running but blocks all trade attempts when kill switch active

- **Reconciler (Non-Blocking)** - core/ExchangeReconciler.js:56-59
  - Fixed reconciler to not throw and crash bot on initial failure in LIVE mode
  - Now just pauses trading and keeps process alive
  - Paper mode: non-blocking startup, log-only drift handling (never pauses)
  - Live mode: blocks until first reconcile, but doesn't crash on failure
  - Added paper mode check to handleDrift() - only logs drift, never pauses

- **Configurable Reconcile Interval** - run-empire-v2.js:345
  - Added RECONCILE_INTERVAL_MS environment variable
  - Default 5000ms (5 seconds) instead of hardcoded 30000ms
  - Allows faster drift detection without code changes

### Changed
- Updated .gitignore to exclude codebase-export.txt from git tracking

## [2.1.4] - 2026-01-02 - Critical Trading Logic Fix

### Fixed
- **Bot lost $3,160 due to backwards confidence calculation**
  - Bot was buying at RSI 98-99 with 96.5% confidence (should be SELL signal)
  - Added RSI Safety Override in OptimizedTradingBrain.js lines 2771-2782
    - Blocks BUY when RSI > 80
    - Blocks SELL when RSI < 20
- **SELL→BUY conversion bug**
  - Bot was converting SELL signals to BUY when unable to short
  - Fixed in run-empire-v2.js lines 1566-1581 to HOLD instead
- **Broken EXIT logic - bot stuck in positions**
  - Bot couldn't exit positions, missing new 96.5% confidence opportunities
  - Fixed in run-empire-v2.js lines 1677-1698
    - Added fallback exit conditions when MaxProfitManager isn't active
    - Exit at 0.35% profit (covers 0.32% fees)
    - Stop loss at -1.5%
    - Brain sell signals work after 30 seconds hold time
- **Raised MIN_TRADE_CONFIDENCE** from 3% to 70% (.env line 180)
  - Filters out weak trades, only takes HIGH PROBABILITY setups
- **Added "shit or get off the pot" rule** (lines 1699-1703)
  - Exit unprofitable positions after 30 minutes
  - Prevents holding losing positions forever
- **Brain Override Fix** (lines 1566-1569)
  - High confidence (70%+) now overrides brain caution
  - Brain was blocking 76% confidence trades despite being above threshold
  - Now: confidence > threshold = GREEN LIGHT (as intended)

### Progress Update
- **Bot improved significantly**: From buying at tops (RSI 98) to proper position management
- **Confidence now makes sense**: 77-82% sell signals when overbought, 10% when neutral
- **Brain direction working**: Correctly identifies buy/sell/hold based on market conditions
- **Safety mechanisms active**: RSI override and SELL→HOLD conversion preventing disasters
- **Exit logic fixed**: 0.35% minimum profit requirement covers fees

## [2.1.3] - 2025-01-01 - Fixed Position Size Unit Mismatch

### Fixed
- **minTradeSize Unit Mismatch**: ExecutionLayer was blocking all trades
  - Changed minTradeSize from 10 (USD) to 0.00001 (BTC) in AdvancedExecutionLayer-439-MERGED.js:36
  - Was comparing BTC amounts (0.00057) against USD minimum (10)
  - Pattern-based sizing confirmed still working at lines 1760-1765
- **ExecutionLayer Unit Mismatch**: Fixed BTC/USD confusion
  - Line 1814: Changed to pass USD amount (positionSize * price) instead of BTC
  - ExecutionLayer expects USD but was receiving BTC amounts
  - This caused "Base 0.00%" in OptimizedTradingBrain calculations
  - Bot can now properly calculate position sizes and execute trades

## [2.1.2] - 2025-01-01 - Critical Execution Fix

### Fixed
- **Line 1219 Execution Crash**: Fixed undefined `this.candles` reference preventing trades
  - Changed `this.candles.length` to `this.priceHistory.length` at run-empire-v2.js:1219
  - Changed `this.candles` to `this.priceHistory` at run-empire-v2.js:1220
  - Fixed calculateAutoDrawLevels property mismatches:
    - Line 1267-1268: Changed `c.high` to `c.h`, `c.low` to `c.l`
    - Line 1431-1432: Changed `c.high` to `c.h`, `c.low` to `c.l`
    - Line 1465-1466: Changed `c.high` to `c.h`, `c.low` to `c.l`
  - Added defensive checks for priceHistory existence at line 1219
  - Bot can now execute BUY/SELL orders without crashing
  - Error was: "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'length')"

## [2.1.1] - 2025-12-31 - Critical API Key Fix

### Fixed
- **Duplicate KRAKEN_API_KEY in .env**: Removed placeholder causing authentication failure
  - Line 170 had `KRAKEN_API_KEY=[REDACTED:api-key]` (placeholder)
  - Line 185 had real API key but was being ignored
  - Node.js uses FIRST occurrence, so bot was trying to auth with placeholder
  - Removed line 170, now using real key from line 185
  - Trading operations now properly authenticated

  - Removed WebSocket import from KrakenIBrokerAdapter (line 18)
  - Updated disconnect() and unsubscribeAll() methods for V2 architecture
  - Verified: Single "Kraken WebSocket connected" message in logs
  - Result: True V2 architecture with single BrokerFactory connection

## [3.0.0] - 2025-12-31 - V2 ARCHITECTURE IMPLEMENTATION
### Changed - BREAKING
- **Complete V2 Architecture Implementation**: Single source of truth via BrokerFactory
  - Removed multiple duplicate WebSocket connections to Kraken (was 3-4, now 1)
  - Implemented event-driven data flow: Kraken → BrokerFactory → Bot → Dashboard
  - Bot now subscribes to broker events instead of direct connections

### Fixed
- **Data Consistency Issues**: Eliminated mixed data sources causing "fake" looking candles
  - Pattern memory was getting corrupted from multiple competing connections
  - Dashboard was receiving inconsistent data from different sources
  - Timestamps now properly synchronized (UTC standard)

### Added
- **Event Emitter in KrakenIBrokerAdapter**: Broker now emits OHLC events
  - Added `this.emit('ohlc', data)` for subscribers (line 297)
  - Added `this.emit('connected')` event on broker connect (line 40)
- **subscribeToMarketData() method**: Replaces direct WebSocket connection
  - Located in run-empire-v2.js (lines 699-731)
  - Subscribes to broker events instead of creating own connection

### Removed
- **Direct Kraken WebSocket in run-empire-v2.js**: Eliminated duplicate connection
  - Deprecated connectToMarketData() function (lines 737-798)
  - Was creating competing connection at line 701

### Investigation Process
- **Initial Issue**: User suspected dashboard showing fake/corrupted candle data
- **Root Cause Found**: Multiple duplicate WebSocket connections competing:
  - run-empire-v2.js line 701: Direct WebSocket to Kraken
  - kraken_adapter_simple.js line 466: Adapter's own WebSocket
  - KrakenIBrokerAdapter.js line 247: Another WebSocket connection
  - ogzprime-ssl-server.js line 170: Disabled Kraken connection
- **Temporary Fix Applied**: Restored direct connection while designing proper solution
- **Final Fix**: Implemented proper V2 event-driven architecture

### Technical Details
- **Before**: Multiple connections → Mixed data → Pattern corruption
- **After**: Single BrokerFactory connection → Clean event flow → Consistent data
- **Pattern Memory**: Cleared and reset to rebuild with clean V2 data
- **Performance**: Real-time data flow with <10 second timestamp accuracy
- **Verification**: All 6 tests passed (single connection, data flow, dashboard reception, timestamps, pattern memory, no conflicts)

## [2.6.1] - 2025-12-30 - CRITICAL FIXES SESSION 2

### Added
- Created SYSTEM-ARCHITECTURE-PACKET.md for multi-modal collaboration
  - Comprehensive documentation of all system modules
  - Data flow diagrams and architecture overview
  - Current issues and attempted solutions documented
  - Testing commands and critical code sections

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL BUG**: Dashboard updateChart() was checking for wrong chart variable
  - Line 1594: Was checking `if (!chart)` from old Chart.js implementation
  - Now correctly checks `if (!window.candlestickSeries)` for TradingView
  - This was preventing ALL chart updates from reaching the display
- Nginx configuration updated to serve from /opt/ogzprime/OGZPMLV2/public
- Removed duplicate /var/www/ogzprime.com directory

### Added - Debug Checkpoints
- Chart initialization: Lines 1103-1158
- WebSocket message handling: Line 1395
- Chart update process: Lines 1626-1642
- Debug output shows: library load, chart creation, candle data flow

## [2.4.4] - 2025-12-27 (Chart Modifications - Part 2)

### Changed - Chart Implementation
- Modified `public/unified-dashboard-refactor.html` chart type multiple times:
  - Changed from line to candlestick (attempting OHLCV display)

## [2.4.2] - 2025-12-27 (Later)

### Critical Discovery - Unhooked Features Audit
- **MAJOR FINDING**: 43% of enabled features weren't actually hooked up (5 out of 7)
- Created `ogz-meta/audit-features.js` to systematically find all unhooked features
- Audit revealed:
  - ✅ PAPER_TRADING: Hooked up and working
  - ✅ CIRCUIT_BREAKER: Hooked up (but blocking trades, kept disabled)
  - ❌ PATTERN_MEMORY_PARTITION: Enabled but not working
  - ❌ PATTERN_BASED_SIZING: Hardcoded to false
  - ❌ WEBSOCKET_DASHBOARD: Enabled but uncertain if sending updates
  - ❌ BACKTEST_API: Enabled but never used
  - ❌ PATTERN_EXIT_MODEL: Running in shadow mode only

### Fixed - Feature Hookups
- **PATTERN_BASED_SIZING** (`core/TradingOptimizations.js`):
  - Problem: Line 26 hardcoded `enablePatternSizeScaling: false`
  - Fixed: Lines 15-21 now read from `config/features.json`
  - Created test: `test-pattern-sizing.js` - confirms working

- **PATTERN_MEMORY_PARTITION** (`core/EnhancedPatternRecognition.js`):
  - Problem: All modes using single `pattern-memory.json` file
  - Fixed: Lines 185-187 now create mode-specific files
  - Files: `pattern-memory.paper.json`, `pattern-memory.live.json`, `pattern-memory.backtest.json`
  - Created test: `test-pattern-partition.js` - confirms separation

### In Progress - Pipeline Fixes
- Running Claudito pipeline for remaining unhooked features:
  - WEBSOCKET_DASHBOARD (pipeline ID: f940a0)
  - BACKTEST_API (pipeline ID: b1f46f)
  - PATTERN_EXIT_MODEL (pipeline ID: 6a8130)

### Lessons Learned
- "Production ready" bot had nearly half its features not working
- Feature flags in config don't guarantee features are actually hooked up
- Need systematic audits to verify feature integration
- Test scripts essential for validating fixes

## [2.4.1] - 2025-12-27

### Critical Bugs Discovered
- 🐛 **MAJOR: Position Sizing Unit Confusion** - Bot treating USD amounts as BTC amounts
  - Line 1474 in run-empire-v2.js: `baseSize = currentBalance * basePositionPercent` calculates $500
  - Bot interprets this as 500 BTC instead of $500 worth of BTC
  - Caused bot to think it had 500 BTC position (worth ~$43M) with only $10k account
  - Trading halted after 2 trades due to "Large drift detected"
  - Need to convert: `positionSizeBTC = baseSizeUSD / currentPrice`
  - Affects: run-empire-v2.js, ExecutionLayer, all position calculations

### Infrastructure Issues Found
- 📁 **Pattern Memory Not Separated by Mode**
  - Config says: pattern_memory.paper.json, pattern_memory.live.json
  - Reality: All modes writing to single pattern-memory.json (contaminated data)
- 📊 **Logs Not Separated by Mode**
  - No paper/live/backtest separation in logs
  - Single telemetry.jsonl (17MB), single error.log
- 🖥️ **Dashboard WebSocket Issues**
  - Dashboard HTML serves but real-time updates not working
  - Bot shows "connected=true" but dashboard not updating

### Critical Pipeline Fixes
- 🚨 **Disabled auto-deploy.yml workflow**
  - File: .github/workflows/auto-deploy.yml → auto-deploy.yml.DANGEROUS.disabled
  - Contained forbidden `git reset --hard HEAD~1` in rollback section
  - Replaced contents with safe tombstone to prevent CI failures
- 🔒 **Added mission branch enforcement**
  - Added /branch handler in ogz-meta/slash-router.js
  - Creates mission/<id> branches from master
  - Clauditos cannot commit to master (hard block)
- 🛡️ **Added CI guards** (.github/workflows/ci.yml)
  - Blocks `git reset --hard` patterns
  - Blocks `git push --force` patterns
  - Excludes *.disabled files from grep
- 🔧 **Fixed 3 pipeline "silent lie/crash" issues**:
  - **CI/CD** (slash-router.js:379): Changed `node -c` to `node --check`
  - **Forensics** (slash-router.js:356): Replaced "Check memory usage" with `ps aux | grep node`
  - **Pipeline** (pipeline.js:72): Fixed pass-2 debugger manifest assignment `manifest = await route()`

### Security Hardening
- Mission branches enforced via /branch handler
- Committer hard-blocks commits on master (slash-router.js:464-472)
- Warden checks for master branch violations (slash-router.js:583-584)
- CI triggers changed: only runs on mission/**, feature/**, dev (not master)
- Deploy workflow simplified: only deploys from master (human-controlled)
- Removed tag deployments from deploy.yml

### File Changes
- Modified: ogz-meta/slash-router.js (branch handler, committer block, warden check)
- Modified: ogz-meta/pipeline.js (added /branch step, fixed pass-2 debugger)
- Modified: .github/workflows/ci.yml (triggers, forbidden command guard)
- Modified: .github/workflows/deploy.yml (simplified triggers)
- Disabled: .github/workflows/auto-deploy.yml (dangerous git reset --hard)

## [2.4.0] - 2025-12-22

### Added - EMPIRE V2 Architecture
- 🏭 Implemented BrokerFactory pattern for dynamic broker adapter creation
- 🔌 Created KrakenIBrokerAdapter with full IBrokerAdapter interface compliance
- ✅ Added executeTrade method with V2 metadata (decisionId for TRAI learning)

### TODO - In Progress
- Add candlestick visualization to chart
- Fix indicator overlays (RSI, MACD, etc.)
- Add support for multiple chart types (line, candlestick, bar)

## [2.3.9] - 2025-12-22

### Fixed - Dashboard WebSocket Authentication
**Root Cause**: Dashboard was using hardcoded 'CHANGE_ME_IN_PRODUCTION' token while bot was using actual token from .env

**Fixed** (`/opt/ogzprime/OGZPMLV2/public/unified-dashboard-refactor.html`):
- Updated auth token to match WEBSOCKET_AUTH_TOKEN from .env (line 1178)
- Dashboard now successfully authenticates with WebSocket server
- Data flow: Bot → WebSocket Server (port 3010) → Dashboard is now working

### Changed - Website Structure Cleanup
**Reorganized** (`/opt/ogzprime/OGZPMLV2/public/`):
- Consolidated all website files in public/ directory
- Removed public-refactor/ directory (duplicate/obsolete)
- Updated nginx to serve from /opt/ogzprime/OGZPMLV2/public/
- Preserved index.html as landing page/funnel
- unified-dashboard-refactor.html is the trading dashboard

### Lessons Learned
- Read ogz-meta/ documentation FIRST before making changes
- Understand the architecture before assuming file purposes
- Bot has comprehensive documentation that prevents these issues

## [2.3.8] - 2025-12-22

### Fixed - WebSocket Authentication Issues
**Fixed** (`ogzprime-ssl-server.js`):
- Server requires authentication within 10 seconds with `type: 'auth'` message
- Was causing dashboard to disconnect with code 1008 every 10 seconds

**Fixed** (`/var/www/ogzprime.com/unified-dashboard-refactor.html`):
- Added proper authentication flow: send auth token first, then identify after auth_success (lines 1177-1186, 1217-1227)
- Added comprehensive WebSocket debugging to track close codes (lines 1126-1210)
- Fixed reconnection backoff logic to prevent connection spam

**Fixed** (`/var/www/ogzprime.com/index.html`):
- Same authentication flow fixes as unified-dashboard-refactor.html (lines 1177-1186, 1217-1234)
- Added WebSocket debugging capabilities

**Fixed** (`run-empire-v2.js`):
- Bot now waits for auth_success before sending identify message (lines 502-519, 538-563)
- Uses default token 'CHANGE_ME_IN_PRODUCTION' when WEBSOCKET_AUTH_TOKEN not set
- Properly handles authentication handshake with dashboard

### WebSocket Architecture Summary
- **Port 3010**: ogzprime-ssl-server.js - Main WebSocket server with authentication
- **Port 3012**: dashboard-server.js - Legacy dashboard server (no auth)
- **Nginx**: Proxies /ws to port 3010 for production access
- **Flow**: Client → Auth → Auth Success → Identify → Connected

## [2.3.7] - 2025-12-21

### Fixed - Critical Integration Issues
**Fixed** (`core/StateManager.js`):
- Added missing `pauseTrading()` method (lines 359-379)
- Added missing `resumeTrading()` method (lines 385-403)
- These methods are called by EventLoopMonitor and stale feed detection

**Fixed** (`kraken_adapter_simple.js`):
- Added `getBalance()` method as alias to getAccountBalance (lines 254-271)
- Added `getOpenPositions()` method as alias to getPositions (lines 274-276)
- Added `getOpenOrders()` stub method (lines 279-283)
- These methods are required by ExchangeReconciler

**Fixed** (`core/ExchangeReconciler.js`):
- Added paperMode flag to skip reconciliation in paper trading (line 19, 87-90)
- Prevents false drift alerts when comparing paper balance to real exchange

**Fixed** (`run-empire-v2.js`):
- Fixed position sizing to use current balance from StateManager instead of stale systemState (lines 1385-1390)
- Increased stale feed tolerance from 30s to 90s for poor network conditions (line 751)
- Added paperMode flag to reconciler initialization (line 319)
- Fixed WebSocket connection URL to use /ws path for ogzprime-ssl-server (line 495)

### Changed - Dashboard Configuration
**Changed** (`/var/www/ogzprime.com/`):
- Made unified-dashboard-refactor.html the main index.html
- Updated nginx to proxy WebSocket correctly to port 3010

### Technical Debt
- Multiple WebSocket servers running (dashboard-server.js on 3012, ogzprime-ssl-server.js on 3010)
- Bot WebSocket connection still getting 400 errors despite fixes
- Need to consolidate to single WebSocket server

## [2.3.6] - 2025-12-20

### Fixed - Pattern Recording System
**Fixed** (`core/EnhancedPatternRecognition.js`):
- Separated array validation from empty array check (lines 874-887)
- Empty feature arrays now log warning instead of error
- Bot continues trading with empty patterns during warmup

### Changed - Trading Configuration
**Changed** (`config/features.json`):
- Enabled PATTERN_DOMINANCE feature for pattern-based entry gating
- Pattern system now actively influences trading decisions

### Configuration - Scalping Mode
**Current Settings**:
- Position Size: 5% of balance (MAX_POSITION_SIZE_PCT=0.05)
- Stop Loss: 1.5% (tight for scalping)
- Take Profit: 2.0% (quick profit taking)
- Min Confidence: 3% (ultra aggressive entry)
- MaxProfitManager Tiers: 0.5%, 1.0%, 1.5%, 2.5% (scalping targets)
- Single position management (closes before opening new)

## [2.3.5] - 2025-12-18

### Added - Critical Safety Features Implementation

#### Order Idempotency System
**Implemented** (`core/AdvancedExecutionLayer-439-MERGED.js`):
- Unique `intentId` generation for every trade based on symbol+direction+confidence+timestamp
- `clientOrderId` generation from intentId for exchange-level deduplication
- Duplicate prevention cache with 5-minute TTL
- Automatic rejection of duplicate orders with original order info returned

**Changes:**
1. **Intent Tracking** (lines 51-53):
   - `submittedIntents` Map tracks all order submissions
   - Auto-cleanup of old intents after TTL expiry

2. **Deduplication Methods** (lines 75-114):
   - `generateIntentId()`: Creates unique trade identifier
   - `generateClientOrderId()`: Ensures same intent → same order ID
   - `checkDuplicateIntent()`: Prevents duplicate submissions

3. **Trade Execution** (lines 148-171):
   - Check for duplicates before any order submission
   - Record intent before sending to exchange
   - Update intent status after successful execution

#### Exchange Reconciliation System
**Created** (`core/ExchangeReconciler.js`):
- Complete truth-source reconciliation with exchange
- 30-second automatic reconciliation interval
- Drift detection with configurable thresholds
- Automatic pause on large drift or unknown positions

**Features:**
1. **Startup Reconciliation**:
   - Blocks trading until initial sync completes
   - Ensures state matches exchange before any trades

2. **Drift Thresholds**:
   - Position warning: 0.001 BTC
   - Position pause: 0.01 BTC
   - Balance warning: $5
   - Balance pause: $10

3. **Drift Handling**:
   - Auto-correction for small drift
   - Trading pause for large drift
   - Hard stop for critical issues (unknown positions)

**Integration** (`run-empire-v2.js`):
- Lines 311-317: Reconciler initialization
- Lines 560-563: Startup blocking reconciliation
- Ensures exchange is truth source before trading begins

#### Pattern Recording Fix
**Fixed** (`run-empire-v2.js`):
- Lines 831-837: Always create valid features array for pattern detection
- Lines 1566-1572: Fallback to entry indicators for pattern recording
- Resolves "Expected features array, got: object" errors

## [2.3.4] - 2025-12-18

### Added - Production Safety Gates & Critical Audit

#### Technical Gates Checklist Enhancement
Comprehensive safety gates added for production deployment based on real-world bot failure patterns.

**New Gates Added** (`TECHNICAL-GATES-CHECKLIST.md`):
1. **Gate 1 - Process Safety & Single Instance** (NEW):
   - Single instance lock verification
   - Event loop lag monitoring requirements
   - Graceful shutdown procedures
   - Memory leak detection

2. **Enhanced Execution Correctness** (Gate 4):
   - Idempotency requirements with intentId/clientOrderId
   - Deduplication store implementation
   - Bounded retry with exponential backoff
   - Order lifecycle tracking

3. **Enhanced Reconciliation** (Gate 5):
   - Truth hierarchy (Exchange → StateManager → Logs)
   - 30-second reconciliation interval
   - Drift thresholds and auto-pause
   - Startup reconciliation blocks trading

4. **Gate 12 - Two-Key Turn Safety** (NEW):
   - Dual environment variable requirement
   - Launch confirmation prompt
   - 10-second countdown before trading
   - Initial position size reduction

#### Critical Safety Audit Results
**Status**: NOT READY FOR PRODUCTION

**Implemented** ✅:
- SingletonLock (core/SingletonLock.js)
- State persistence (core/StateManager.js)
- Partial stale feed detection

**MISSING CRITICAL** ❌:
- Order idempotency/deduplication
- Exchange reconciliation loop
- Event loop lag monitoring
- Two-key turn activation

**Files Created**:
- `SAFETY-VERIFICATION-STATUS.md` - Detailed implementation audit
- Updated `GO-LIVE-COUNTDOWN-CHECKLIST.md` - Fixed withdrawal contradiction

**Impact**: Bot cannot safely go live until missing safety features are implemented.

### Enhanced - Dashboard Chart Integration
**Date**: 2025-12-16

#### Improvements to Live Data Display
Enhanced the dashboard to properly handle and display Kraken OHLC (Open, High, Low, Close) candlestick data.

**Changes** (`/var/www/ogzprime.com/unified-dashboard-refactor.html`):

1. **Enhanced Chart Update Function** (lines 1348-1396):
   - Now properly handles full OHLC candle data from bot
   - Stores candle history in `window.candleData` for candlestick charts
   - Uses historical candles array when available for smoother updates
   - Maintains 50-candle rolling window for performance

2. **Improved Candlestick Chart Support** (lines 1583-1614):
   - Candlestick chart type now uses actual OHLC data
   - Green bars for bullish candles (close >= open)
   - Red bars for bearish candles (close < open)
   - Bar height represents price range (high - low)

**Data Flow Verified**:
- Bot connects to Kraken WebSocket at `wss://ws.kraken.com`
- Subscribes to 1-minute OHLC candles for XBT/USD
- Forwards complete candle data to dashboard via port 3010
- Dashboard now properly displays this data in charts

**Result**:
- Real-time Kraken price data displayed on dashboard
- Full candlestick chart functionality restored
- Historical price data properly rendered
- Smooth chart updates with 50-candle history

## [2.3.3] - 2025-12-16

### Fixed - Pattern Memory Mode Detection

Fixed critical issue where pattern memory mode detection logic was incorrect,
potentially allowing backtest patterns to contaminate live/paper trading data.

**Changes** (`core/PatternMemoryBank.js`):
1. **Mode Detection Logic** (lines 36-43):
   - Fixed incorrect ternary operator that always returned 'backtest'
   - Now properly detects: backtest, live, or paper mode
   - Defaults to 'paper' for safety

2. **Path Handling** (lines 59-67):
   - When dbPath provided in config, appends mode suffix
   - Example: `learned_patterns.json` → `learned_patterns.paper.json`
   - Ensures complete separation even with custom paths

**Result**:
- Backtest patterns stored in: `*.backtest.json`
- Paper trading patterns in: `*.paper.json`
- Live trading patterns in: `*.live.json`
- No cross-contamination between modes

## [2.3.2] - 2025-12-16

### Added - Pattern-Based Exit Model & Mode-Aware Memory

#### Pattern Exit Model (Shadow Mode by Default)
Complete pattern-driven exit intelligence that enhances MaxProfitManager without replacing it.

**Feature Flags** (`config/features.json`):
- `PATTERN_EXIT_MODEL.enabled`: false (default)
- `PATTERN_EXIT_MODEL.shadowMode`: true (logs only, no actions)
- When shadow mode OFF: Only exits on high/critical urgency

**Implementation** (`run-empire-v2.js`):
1. **Initialization** (lines 243-250):
   - Creates PatternBasedExitModel if feature enabled
   - Sets shadow mode flag for logging vs active

2. **Entry Tracking** (lines 1371-1387):
   - Starts pattern exit tracking on BUY
   - Calculates pattern-predicted target/stop based on historical data
   - Logs targets in shadow mode

3. **Exit Evaluation** (lines 1119-1157):
   - Evaluates exit signals on each tick
   - Checks for reversal patterns, momentum exhaustion
   - Logs what WOULD happen in shadow mode
   - Triggers exit on high/critical urgency in active mode

4. **Cleanup** (lines 1600-1609):
   - Stops tracking on position close
   - Records outcome for pattern learning

**Exit Signals**:
- Reversal pattern detection (shooting star, double top, etc.)
- Momentum exhaustion (RSI extremes, MACD divergence)
- Pattern target reached (historical avg gain)
- Profit protection (giving back gains)

#### Mode-Aware Pattern Memory Persistence

**Problem**: Backtest was contaminating live pattern memory with simulated data.

**Solution** (`core/PatternMemoryBank.js`):
1. **Mode Detection** (lines 35-58):
   - Detects mode: live/paper/backtest from env
   - Uses separate files per mode:
     - `pattern_memory.live.json`
     - `pattern_memory.paper.json`
     - `pattern_memory.backtest.json`

2. **Persistence Control** (lines 480-484):
   - Backtest mode: persistence DISABLED by default
   - Prevents contamination of live patterns
   - Can override with `backtestPersist: true`

3. **Feature Flag** (`PATTERN_MEMORY_PARTITION`):
   - Enabled by default
   - Configurable file paths per mode
   - `backtestPersist: false` prevents backtest writes

This ensures backtest, paper, and live trading maintain completely separate pattern memories, preventing strategy contamination from simulated data.

## [2.3.1] - 2025-12-16

### Added - Feature Flags Configuration System

#### Centralized Feature Management
Created **config/features.json** for managing all feature toggles and experimental settings.

#### Implementation Details:
1. **Feature Flags File** (`config/features.json`):
   - Centralized configuration for all features
   - Per-feature settings and thresholds
   - Environment mode configuration
   - Version tracking per feature

2. **Bot Integration** (`run-empire-v2.js`):
   - Loads feature flags on startup (lines 28-36)
   - Passes flags to TradingBrain (lines 216-218)
   - Passes flags to ExecutionLayer (lines 236-237)
   - Auto-logs enabled features on boot

3. **Available Features**:
   - **PATTERN_DOMINANCE** (v2.3.0) - OFF by default
     - Empire Pattern-driven entry gating
     - Configurable tier thresholds and multipliers
   - **PATTERN_BASED_SIZING** (v2.2.0) - ON
     - Dynamic position sizing based on pattern win rates
   - **PAPER_TRADING** (v2.1.3) - ON
     - Paper trading mode for testing
   - **CIRCUIT_BREAKER** (v2.0.0) - ON
     - Error cascade prevention
   - **TRAI_INFERENCE** (v2.1.0) - OFF
     - AI model inference (requires inference server)
   - **WEBSOCKET_DASHBOARD** (v2.1.4) - ON
     - Real-time dashboard updates
   - **BACKTEST_API** (v2.1.4) - ON
     - REST API on port 3011

#### Usage:
To enable Empire Pattern Dominance:
1. Edit `config/features.json`
2. Set `PATTERN_DOMINANCE.enabled: true`
3. Restart bot - will log: "[FEATURES] Loaded feature flags: [..., PATTERN_DOMINANCE]"

This provides a clean, version-controlled way to manage experimental features without environment variable clutter.

## [2.3.0] - 2025-12-16

### 🚀 EMPIRE PATTERN DOMINANCE - Complete Pattern-Driven Entry System

#### The Paradigm Shift
**Before**: Indicators → Confidence → Trade (patterns were advisory)
**After**: Patterns → Gate → Indicators → Size (patterns are PRIMARY)

This changes the hierarchy of truth in the system - patterns now decide IF to trade, indicators decide HOW MUCH.

#### Feature Flag Implementation
**CRITICAL**: All Empire features are behind feature flags - OFF by default
- Environment variable: `PATTERN_DOMINANCE=true`
- Or config setting: `config.patternDominance: true`
- When disabled, system operates exactly as before

#### Implementation Details (OptimizedTradingBrain.js)

##### Pattern Entry Gating (Lines 3113-3184)
**NEW PHASE 2.5** inserted between confidence calculation and direction determination

###### 3-Tier Pattern Classification System:
1. **ELITE** (Win Rate ≥75%, Samples ≥20)
   - Confidence boost: +0.3
   - Size multiplier: 1.5x (aggressive)
   - Always approved for entry

2. **PROVEN** (Win Rate ≥65%, Samples ≥10)
   - Confidence boost: +0.15
   - Size multiplier: 1.0x (standard)
   - Approved with standard confidence

3. **WEAK** (Win Rate <50%, Samples ≥5)
   - Confidence penalty: -0.2
   - Size multiplier: 0.5x (reduced)
   - May be blocked if confidence too low

4. **LEARNING** (Insufficient data)
   - Requires 2+ confluence signals to trade
   - Size multiplier: 0.3x (probe size)
   - Blocked without confluence

##### Confluence Scoring System (Lines 2146-2180)
New method: `countConfluenceSignals()`
Checks 6 confluence factors:
- TPO crossover signal
- Fibonacci levels (0.618, 0.382)
- Support/Resistance proximity
- Strong trend alignment
- RSI extremes (<30 or >70)
- MACD crossover

##### Pattern Size Override (Lines 3247-3252)
- Applied AFTER base position sizing
- Multiplies final size by pattern tier multiplier
- Logged for transparency
- Respects max position limits

##### Decision Output Enhancement (Lines 3284-3291)
Added to decision object when pattern dominance enabled:
- `patternTier`: Current pattern classification
- `patternGated`: Whether pattern gate blocked entry

#### Gating Logic
- Pattern gate runs BEFORE direction determination
- Can completely block trades with `return { direction: 'hold', blocked: 'PATTERN_GATE' }`
- Elite patterns bypass most restrictions
- Weak patterns need extra confidence to pass

#### Safety Features
- All changes isolated behind feature flag
- Original logic completely preserved when disabled
- Pattern size overrides clamped (0.3x to 1.5x)
- Logging at every decision point

#### Backups Created
- `core/OptimizedTradingBrain.backup-pre-empire-20251216.js`
- Full system backup in `backups/` directory

#### Expected Impact (Per Simulation)
- **+22% ROI improvement** from smarter entry selection
- **-18% Drawdown reduction** from avoiding weak patterns
- **Better compounding** as pattern library matures
- **No additional risk** - same number of signals, better filtering

## [2.2.0] - 2025-12-15

### 🎯 Pattern-Based Position Sizing Implementation

#### The Big Win - ROI Optimization Without Risk Increase
As identified in the final audit: "lowest-risk, highest-return improvement available"

#### Implementation Details (OptimizedTradingBrain.js)

##### New Position Sizing Logic (Lines 1653-1680)
- **Added**: Pattern-based sizing phase BEFORE basic sizing
- **Location**: Between quantum sizing (elite) and basic sizing (all tiers)
- **Formula**: `patternSizeMultiplier = 0.5 + patternWinRate`
- **Safety Clamps**: Min 0.75x, Max 1.5x position size
- **Sample Size Gate**: Requires 10+ historical occurrences

##### Multiplier Logic
```
Win Rate 70%+ → 1.5x position size (max)
Win Rate 50%  → 1.0x position size (baseline)
Win Rate 30%- → 0.75x position size (min)
```

##### Integration Points
- **Line 1692**: Applied to final size calculation
- **Line 1697**: Logged in position sizing output
- **Line 1699**: Included in max size constraint

##### New Method: getPatternSampleSize (Lines 2145-2175)
- **Purpose**: Count historical occurrences of pattern type
- **Primary Source**: ProfilePatternManager (if available)
- **Fallback**: Legacy pattern memory
- **Returns**: Total number of times pattern has been seen

#### Expected Impact (Per Audit Report)
- **+15-25% ROI improvement** from smarter bet sizing
- **Same trades, same signals** - only size changes
- **Risk profile unchanged** - frequency stays same
- **Compounds with learning** - gets better over time

## [2.1.4] - 2025-12-15

### 🔧 Critical Dataflow & Schema Fixes (Full-System Architecture Audit Response)

#### 🔴 CRITICAL Issues Fixed

##### Timestamp Semantic Mismatch (run-empire-v2.js:681)
- **Problem**: marketData.timestamp was using `Date.now()` instead of candle's actual time
- **Impact**: All time-based calculations using wrong timestamp (could be seconds/minutes off)
- **Fix**: Changed to `parseFloat(time) * 1000` to use candle's actual timestamp
- **Added**: `systemTime: Date.now()` field to preserve system time if needed
- **Files**: run-empire-v2.js lines 678-687

##### Pattern Signature Generation Defect (run-empire-v2.js:797)
- **Problem**: Fallback used `unknown_${Date.now()}` creating unique signature every detection
- **Impact**: Every pattern detection created new signature, preventing learning/recognition
- **Fix**: Changed to static `unknown_pattern` fallback
- **Result**: Patterns can now be learned and recognized across sessions
- **Files**: run-empire-v2.js lines 796-801

#### 📊 Schema Mismatches Identified & Documented

##### Unit Inconsistencies Found
- **Position Size**: AdvancedExecutionLayer stores BOTH fraction (0-1) and USD in same object
  - `position.positionSize`: fraction (0.05 = 5%)
  - `position.tradeValue`: USD ($500)
  - **Risk**: Code reading wrong field gets wrong units

##### Indicator Output Schemas
- **RSI**: 0-100 range
- **Volatility**: 0-1 range (0.02 = 2%)
- **MACD**: Returns {macd, macdSignal} but was being accessed incorrectly
- **Confidence**: Normalized from 0-100 to 0-1 before execution

#### ✅ Verified Clean
- **Moon Shot Test Code**: CONFIRMED REMOVED
  - No $95,000 price override found
  - No test warmup bypass (requires 15 candles)
  - System running on real market data
- **MACD Assignment**: Fixed at line 749 - properly assigned to indicators object
- **State Mutations**: All going through StateManager with proper locking

## [2.1.3] - 2025-12-15

### 🚨 Critical Security & Safety Fixes (Deep Architecture Audit Response)

#### 🛡️ Circuit Breaker System Implementation

##### Pre-Execution Safety Gate (run-empire-v2.js:1236)
- **Added**: Circuit breaker check BEFORE any trade execution
- **Code**: `if (this.tradingBrain?.errorHandler?.isCircuitBreakerActive('ExecutionLayer'))`
- **Behavior**: Blocks ALL trades after 5 consecutive failures
- **Protection**: Prevents cascade failures during error conditions

##### Error Reporting Integration (run-empire-v2.js:1544)
- **Added**: Automatic error reporting to circuit breaker on trade failures
- **Code**: `this.tradingBrain.errorHandler.reportCritical('ExecutionLayer', error, context)`
- **Tracks**: Failed trades with decision, confidence, and position size
- **Result**: Circuit breaker activates automatically on repeated failures

#### 🔄 Return Shape Consistency Fix

##### ExecutionLayer NO_HOLDINGS Case (AdvancedExecutionLayer-439-MERGED.js:180)
- **Problem**: Returned `{executed: false}` instead of `{success: false}`
- **Impact**: Caller checking `tradeResult.success` got undefined
- **Behavior**: Safe failure (undefined = false) but no explicit error handling
- **Fix**: Normalized to `{success: false}` matching all other return paths
- **Files**: core/AdvancedExecutionLayer-439-MERGED.js lines 177-184

#### 📋 Comprehensive Safety Verification
- **7 Failure Gates**: All verified to abort without state mutation
- **Atomic Pattern**: executeTrade() → success → closePosition() confirmed
- **State Integrity**: No side-channels, no race conditions, locks verified
- **Single Source of Truth**: StateManager is authoritative for all state

### ✅ Paper Trading Complete Overhaul (2025-12-15 Session)

#### 🔧 StateManager Fixes (CRITICAL - Money Printer Bug)

##### Position Update Fix (StateManager.js:196-248)
- **BUG**: PnL calculation treating USD position as BTC units
- **Example**: $500 position treated as 500 BTC = $44,809,300 value
- **Impact**: Balance exploding from $10,000 to $64,849 on single trade
- **Root Cause**: `const pnl = closeSize * priceChange;` (should be percentage-based)
- **FIX**: `const pnl = closeSize * priceChangePercent;`
- **Verification**: Tested with real trades, PnL now accurate to cents

##### Missing set() Method (StateManager.js:114)
- **BUG**: "TypeError: this.set is not a function"
- **Impact**: Trades failing with cryptic error
- **FIX**: Added `set(key, value) { this.state[key] = value; return value; }`
- **Result**: State updates working correctly

##### State Persistence Fix (run-empire-v2.js:307-319)
- **BUG**: Bot wiping state on every restart (amnesia)
- **Code Before**: Always called `stateManager.updateState()` with fresh values
- **Code After**: Check existing state first: `if (!currentState.balance || currentState.balance === 0)`
- **Impact**: Trades and balance now persist through restarts

#### 🎯 ExecutionLayer Fixes

##### Success Field Normalization (AdvancedExecutionLayer-439-MERGED.js:287-295)
- **BUG**: Paper mode returning `success: true` but live mode returning different fields
- **Impact**: Inconsistent handling between modes
- **FIX**: Added `success: true` field to all paper trade returns
- **Verified**: Both modes now return consistent shape

##### Position Tracking (Multiple fixes in ExecutionLayer)
- **BUG**: ExecutionLayer not updating StateManager
- **FIX**: Proper state mutation flow through StateManager
- **Verified**: Positions update immediately on trade execution

#### 🌐 Website & Dashboard Deployment

##### Unified Dashboard Upgrade (unified-dashboard.html)
- **Added**: TradingView Lightweight Charts library integration
- **Feature**: Toggle button to switch between Chart.js and TradingView
- **Charts**: Professional candlestick with OHLC data and volume histogram
- **Interaction**: Crosshair, zoom, pan, auto-resize on window changes
- **WebSocket**: Fixed URL from `ws://127.0.0.1:3010/ws` to `wss://ogzprime.com/ws`
- **Deployment**: Copied to `/var/www/ogzprime.com/` for production
- **Live at**: https://ogzprime.com/unified-dashboard.html

##### Atomic Execution Marketing (public/ folder updates)
- **Homepage Hook** (index.html after hero section):
  - Brief teaser about atomic execution
  - Links to detailed WHY OGZP page
- **Technical Page** (why-ogzp.html created):
  - Full explanation of atomic execution model
  - Execute → Confirm → Update State pattern
  - Targets engineers and serious traders
  - Emphasizes reliability over speed

#### 🔬 Backtest System Implementation

##### REST API Creation (backtest/backtest-api.js - Port 3011)
- **Endpoints**:
  - `POST /backtest` - Run backtest with parameters
  - `POST /optimize` - Genetic algorithm parameter search
  - `GET /results/:id` - Retrieve backtest results
- **WebSocket**: Real-time progress updates during backtests
- **Integration**: Uses OptimizedBacktestEngine with tier features
- **Error Handling**: Try-catch wrapping for indicator calculations

##### Backtest Engine Issues Found
- **Bug**: "OptimizedIndicators is not a constructor"
- **Bug**: RSI calculation "Cannot read properties of undefined"
- **Status**: Needs fixing but API framework complete

#### 🧹 Repository Cleanup

##### Removed Large Files from Git
- `ogz-complete-dump.txt` (2.6MB)
- `ogz-prime-full-repo-dump.txt` (1.2MB)
- `trai_brain/experimental/polygon-btc-1y.json` (9MB)
- All `trai_brain/inference_server*.py` files
- All `__pycache__` directories

##### Updated .gitignore
- Added patterns for dump files
- Added LLM model extensions (.pkl, .h5, .pth, etc.)
- Added state files (state.json, pattern_memory.json)
- Added profile data exclusions

#### 🔬 Verified Trading Behavior
- Bot enters positions after 15 candles (warmup complete)
- Respects "no shorting" rule - converts sell signals to hold when flat
- Emergency sell triggers on -2% loss threshold
- Multiple successful trades executed with small profits
- State persists correctly through entire trading cycle

### 🏆 AUDIT PASSED - ZERO VIOLATIONS
- **DeepSearch Audit Complete**: SELL execution path verified bulletproof
- **7 Failure Gates**: All abort without state mutation
- **Atomic Pattern**: executeTrade() → success → closePosition() confirmed
- **State Integrity**: No side-channels, no race conditions, locks verified
- **Single Source of Truth**: StateManager is authoritative for all state

### ✅ Verified Working
- **SELLS ARE EXECUTING!** CP8 shows successful closes with state updates
- Atomic transaction pattern prevents phantom trades (v2.0.24 fix confirmed)
- Balance correctly updates on sells ($9500 → $10000)
- No retry logic needed - failed sells naturally retry via main loop

### 📋 Planned
- Remove Moon Shot test after validation
- Add circuit breaker to execution pipeline
- Implement proper integration tests for buy→sell cycle

## [2.1.2] - 2025-12-15

### Added
- **TradingView Lightweight Charts integration** to unified-dashboard.html
  - Added toggle button to switch between Chart.js and TradingView
  - Professional candlestick charts with OHLC data
  - Volume histogram visualization
  - Interactive crosshair, zoom, and pan features
  - Auto-resize on window changes
- **Interactive trading features** in dashboard
  - Draggable stop loss/take profit lines (prepared)
  - Real-time WebSocket data integration
  - Drawing tools support (trend lines, fibonacci, etc.)

### Enhanced
- Upgraded main unified-dashboard.html (root directory) with toggle for chart types
- Preserved all existing features (quantum tiers, bot status, indicators)
- Added TradingView container alongside existing Chart.js canvas
- Both chart libraries available - users can switch between them

## [2.1.1] - 2025-12-15

### Added
- Created REST API for backtesting on port 3011 (`backtest/backtest-api.js`)
- OptimizedBacktestEngine with tier-based feature flags (`backtest/OptimizedBacktestEngine.js`)
- Integrated optimizeception module for genetic algorithm parameter search
- Atomic execution messaging on website (homepage hook + WHY OGZP page)
- WebSocket support for real-time backtest progress updates

### Fixed
- Lowered confidence thresholds to 10-30 range for actual trades
- Fixed backtesting API indicator calculation errors with proper error handling
- Wrapped indicator calculations in try-catch to prevent crashes
- Fixed method name from `calculateAll` to `calculateTechnicalIndicators`

## [2.1.0] - 2025-12-15

### ⚠️ BREAKING CHANGES
- **State Schema Change**: `activeTrades` must contain `action` field (not just `type`)
- **Init Behavior**: No longer overwrites existing state on startup
- **Trade Schema**: All trades require: `action`, `entryPrice`, `entryTime` fields

### Added
- State existence check before initialization (`run-empire-v2.js` lines 307-319)
- Trade tracking in StateManager.openPosition() (`core/StateManager.js` lines 173-190)
- Trade removal in StateManager.closePosition() (`core/StateManager.js` lines 225-235)
- Debug logging for trade discovery (`run-empire-v2.js` lines 1060-1073)
- Repository dump script (`create-repo-dump.sh` → `ogz-prime-full-repo-dump.txt`)

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL**: Init was wiping saved state on every startup
  - **Root Cause**: `run-empire-v2.js` always called updateState with fresh values
  - **Fix**: Check if state exists before initializing
  - **Validation**: Log shows "Using existing state" instead of "Initializing fresh state"

- **CRITICAL**: StateManager destroying activeTrades Map
  - **Root Cause**: updateState() line 112 accepting arrays and overwriting Map
  - **Fix**: Special handling for activeTrades to preserve Map type
  - **Validation**: Trades persist through save/load cycle

- **CRITICAL**: Trades had wrong field names preventing P&L calculation
  - **Root Cause**: openPosition() saved `type: 'BUY'` but code filtered for `action === 'BUY'`
  - **Fix**: Added both `action` and `type` fields for compatibility
  - **Validation**: getAllTrades().filter(t => t.action === 'BUY') returns trades

### State Compatibility
- **activeTrades**: `Map<orderId, trade>` persisted as Array pairs
- **Trade Schema**: `{action: 'BUY'|'SELL', type: string, entryPrice: number, entryTime: number}`
- **Migration Policy**: One-time migration for old trades: `if (!trade.action && trade.type) trade.action = trade.type.toUpperCase()`

## [2.0.26] - 2025-12-14

### Added
- Moon Shot test for forcing sell conditions (`run-empire-v2.js` lines 625-639)
- Warmup bypass for faster testing (changed from 15 to 1 candles)

### Known Issues
- Test harness bug: Forces both entry and mark price to $95k
- MaxProfitManager never sees profit delta

## [2.0.25] - 2025-12-13

### Fixed
- ExecutionLayer missing `success: true` field in paper mode
- StateManager missing `set()` method implementation
- Method binding for StateManager to preserve `this` context
- P&L calculation treating dollar positions as BTC units (money printer bug)

### Changed
- Disabled TRAI async calls in trading flow (cluttered logs)

### 🚨 Critical Fixes - Amnesia Bug
- **FIXED: Bot was forgetting all trades, making sells impossible!**
  - File: `core/StateManager.js` lines 113-127
  - Problem: updateState() was overwriting activeTrades Map with empty arrays
  - Solution: Added special handling to protect activeTrades Map integrity
  - Impact: Prevented ALL sells from working, creating orphan positions

- **FIXED: openPosition() wasn't tracking trades**
  - File: `core/StateManager.js` lines 173-190
  - Problem: Positions opened but no trade records created
  - Solution: Now properly adds trades to activeTrades Map
  - Impact: MaxProfitManager can now find trades to check for sells

- **FIXED: closePosition() wasn't removing trades**
  - File: `core/StateManager.js` lines 225-235
  - Problem: Closed trades stayed in memory forever
  - Solution: Now properly removes trades from activeTrades Map
  - Impact: Prevents memory leaks and stale trade data

### Root Cause Analysis
The "Amnesia Bug" was caused by a Map/Array serialization issue:
1. activeTrades stored as Map in memory
2. save() converts Map→Array for JSON
3. updateState() receives empty array from some caller
4. Line 112 overwrites Map with empty array
5. Bot forgets all trades but keeps position
6. MaxProfitManager checks activeTrades (empty) → no sells possible

## [2.0.26] - 2025-12-14 - MOON SHOT TEST: FORCING SELL TO VERIFY P&L

### Testing - Force Sell Scenario
- **Added Moon Shot price injection for testing**
  - File: `run-empire-v2.js` line 625-633
  - Fakes price to $95,000 to trigger immediate sell
  - Tests MaxProfitManager take-profit logic
  - Verifies P&L calculation and balance updates
  - TEMPORARY - Remove after verification

## [2.0.25] - 2025-12-13 - PAPER TRADING FIXED: POSITIONS ACTUALLY UPDATE NOW!

### Fixed - Paper Trading Now Works!
- **ExecutionLayer returned wrong format in paper mode**
  - File: `core/AdvancedExecutionLayer-439-MERGED.js` lines 305-307
  - Added: `success: true` field (was missing, caused positions to never update)
  - Added: `orderId` field for proper trade tracking
  - Impact: Paper trades now actually update positions and balance!

- **StateManager was missing set() method**
  - File: `core/StateManager.js` lines 77-80
  - Added: `set(key, value)` method that was being called but didn't exist
  - Impact: Trades can now be tracked in state without errors

- **StateManager methods losing 'this' context**
  - File: `core/StateManager.js` lines 56-62
  - Added: Method binding in constructor to preserve context
  - Fixed: "this.set is not a function" error when updateActiveTrade called
  - Impact: StateManager methods now work correctly when called from anywhere

- **TRAI removed from trading flow for clean logs**
  - File: `run-empire-v2.js` lines 931-954
  - Disabled: TRAI async calls (was cluttering logs)
  - Impact: Clean, professional trading logs without AI spam

### Known Issues Still To Fix
- Position sizing hardcoded to $500 (should scale with confidence)
- Position size shows as NaN% when tracking
- No sell/close position logic for paper mode yet

## [2.0.24] - 2025-12-13 - SURGICAL ENGINE SWAP: STATE DESYNC & TRAI BLOCKING ELIMINATED

### Fixed - Step 1: Single Source of Truth (STATE DESYNC ELIMINATED)
- **CRITICAL: Removed ALL duplicate state tracking - StateManager is now ONLY truth**
  - File: `run-empire-v2.js` (multiple locations)
  - Deleted: `this.balance` property - was tracking separately from StateManager
  - Deleted: `this.activeTrades` Map - was desyncing from StateManager
  - Impact: No more phantom trades, no more balance mismatches, no more "3 truths = 0 truth"

- **Added trade management methods to StateManager**
  - File: `core/StateManager.js` lines 270-313
  - Added: `updateActiveTrade()`, `removeActiveTrade()`, `getAllTrades()`, `isInSync()`
  - Now StateManager handles ALL trade tracking with disk persistence
  - If bot crashes, trades reload from disk exactly where they left off

- **Replaced ALL state references throughout run-empire-v2.js**
  - `this.balance` → `stateManager.get('balance')` (12 replacements)
  - `this.activeTrades` → `stateManager.getAllTrades()` (5 replacements)
  - `this.activeTrades.set()` → `stateManager.updateActiveTrade()` (1 replacement)
  - `this.activeTrades.delete()` → `stateManager.removeActiveTrade()` (2 replacements)

### Fixed - Step 2: TRAI Async (2-5 SECOND BLOCKING ELIMINATED)
- **CRITICAL: TRAI no longer blocks main trading loop**
  - File: `run-empire-v2.js` lines 931-954
  - Previous: `await this.trai.processDecision()` blocked for 2-5 seconds (LLM thinking)
  - Now: Fire-and-forget async processing - bot NEVER waits for TRAI
  - Impact: Bot can react to flash crashes immediately, no more blindness during volatility
  - TRAI now does post-trade learning only, mathematical logic drives real-time decisions

### Fixed - CRITICAL: Map Serialization (TRADES NOW SURVIVE RESTARTS)
- **StateManager couldn't save/load Maps to JSON**
  - File: `core/StateManager.js` lines 315-379
  - Added: `save()` and `load()` methods with Map↔Array conversion
  - Maps convert to Arrays before JSON.stringify
  - Arrays convert back to Maps after JSON.parse
  - Auto-saves after every state update
  - Auto-loads on startup
  - Impact: Active trades now persist across bot restarts!

### Fixed - Step 3: KrakenAdapterV2 Wrapper (PROPER V2 ARCHITECTURE)
- **Created IBrokerAdapter-compliant wrapper for kraken_adapter_simple**
  - File: `core/KrakenAdapterV2.js` (280+ lines, new file)
  - Wraps existing working adapter without breaking it
  - Implements all 30+ IBrokerAdapter methods
  - Adds position tracking via StateManager
  - Adds account polling (no private WebSocket in simple)
  - Marked as technical debt with migration plan

### Fixed - Step 4: Rate Limiter Queue (NO MORE RECURSION)
- **Replaced recursive retry with simple queue system**
  - File: `kraken_adapter_simple.js` lines 109-204
  - Previous: Recursive call on 429 → promise stack buildup → memory leak
  - Now: Queue-based processing with no recursion
  - Re-queues on 429, pauses processor, resumes after backoff
  - Processes queue every 100ms when active
  - Impact: No more infinite promise accumulation on rate limits

### Fixed - Step 5: Exit Priority (MAXPROFITMANAGER WINS)
- **Math always beats emotions on exits**
  - File: `run-empire-v2.js` lines 1073-1108
  - Previous: Brain 'sell' signal forced exit BEFORE checking MaxProfitManager
  - Now: MaxProfitManager checks FIRST (stops/targets)
  - Brain can only sell if: profitable OR emergency loss > 2%
  - Impact: No more phantom sells cutting winners early

### Verification
✅ **State Desync**: Single source of truth enforced
✅ **TRAI Blocking**: Main loop never waits
✅ **Map Serialization**: Trades persist across restarts
✅ **KrakenAdapterV2**: Proper IBrokerAdapter interface
✅ **Rate Limiter**: Queue-based, no recursion
✅ **Exit Priority**: Math wins over emotions

## [2.0.23] - 2025-12-12 - CRITICAL FIX: BALANCE SYNC IN EXECUTIONLAYER

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL: ExecutionLayer using stale $10k balance instead of current StateManager balance**
  - File: `core/AdvancedExecutionLayer-439-MERGED.js` line 118
  - Problem: Line reads `this.bot.systemState?.currentBalance` (undefined) then falls back to `this.balance` (hardcoded at init)
  - Impact: Position sizing ignores actual balance, creates phantom "negative balance" errors
  - Symptom: StateManager rejects trades with "Cannot set negative balance" even in paper mode
  - Root cause: Balance read from stale field, not from StateManager (single source of truth)
  - Fix: Changed to read from `stateManager.get('balance')` first, with fallbacks
  - Result: Position sizing now sees actual account balance ($450) instead of initial $10k

### Added
- **launch-empire-v2.sh** - Production startup script
  - Starts Dashboard on port 3000 (Python HTTP server)
  - Starts WebSocket on port 3010 (bot can self-create if missing)
  - Validates all required services before starting bot
  - Sets environment variables (BACKTEST_MODE=false, BOT_TIER=ml, TRADING_PROFILE=balanced)
  - Graceful cleanup of stale lock files
  - Colored output for service status (based on FINAL-REFACTOR launcher pattern)

### Fixed  
- **Dashboard not connected**: Bot logs show WebSocket connecting but no HTTP server for dashboard UI
  - Solution: Added Python HTTP server to serve public-refactor/unified-dashboard-refactor.html on port 3000
  - Dashboard now receives live state updates via StateManager broadcasts
  - All message types properly routed (price, trade, state_update, pattern_analysis)

### Verification Status (All 7 Bugs + Infrastructure)
✅ **Core Bugs**: StateManager locks, ErrorHandler circuit breaker, RiskManager UTC, Pattern memory persistence  
✅ **Integration**: StateManager synced with AdvancedExecutionLayer, RiskManager, OptimizedTradingBrain  
✅ **Frontend**: Dashboard state updates, WebSocket message handlers, live P&L display  
✅ **Infrastructure**: TRAI LLM loaded in GPU, startup script created, bot warmup at Candle #7/15

### How to Use
```bash
cd /opt/ogzprime/OGZPMLV2
./launch-empire-v2.sh
```

Bot will:
1. Start dashboard on http://localhost:3000
2. Ensure WebSocket ready on ws://localhost:3010
3. Load TRAI LLM into GPU memory
4. Connect to real Kraken WebSocket (BTC-USD 1m candles)
5. Warm up RSI indicator (need 15 candles = ~15 minutes)
6. Start trading once indicators ready

## [2.0.21] - 2025-12-12 - COMPLETE VERIFICATION: ALL 7 BUGS AUDITED + DATA FLOW MAPPED

### Verification Complete - All Bug Fixes Architecturally Sound

#### ✅ BUG #1: StateManager Lock Race Condition (VERIFIED FIXED)
- **File**: `core/StateManager.js:289-308`
- **Problem**: Race window where next waiter called without lock being released
- **Root cause**: `releaseLock()` set `locked=false` then woke next waiter, but next waiter didn't set lock
- **Fix**: `acquireLock()` now awaits and sets `locked=true` after promise resolves
- **Impact**: Eliminates phantom trades from concurrent state access
- **Verification**: await keyword ensures lock is set AFTER promise resolves - ARCHITECTURALLY SOUND ✅

#### ⚠️ BUG #2: ErrorHandler Circuit Breaker - RETURNS CORRECT FORMAT BUT NEVER CHECKED
- **File**: `core/ErrorHandler.js:38-48`
- **Problem**: Returns `{blocked: true, circuitActive: true}` format but circuit breaker NEVER CONSULTED before trades
- **Issue**: Circuit breaker is non-functional despite returning correct response
- **Status**: ARCHITECTURAL ISSUE - circuit breaker exists but not wired into trade execution
- **Note**: Pattern works correctly but trade execution path doesn't check circuit status
- **Action Needed**: Wire circuit breaker checks into trade execution pipeline before trading

#### ✅ BUG #3: StateManager Operation Success Validation (VERIFIED WORKING)
- **File**: `run-empire-v2.js:1252-1262 (BUY) & 1348-1358 (SELL)`
- **Verification**: Both BUY and SELL explicitly check `positionResult.success`
- **Implementation**: Aborts trade and returns early if StateManager update fails
- **Status**: PROPERLY IMPLEMENTED - No silent desyncs possible ✅

#### ✅ BUG #4: RiskManager Alert Cleanup Timer (VERIFIED CLEARED)
- **File**: `core/RiskManager.js:1898-1901` + `run-empire-v2.js:1756`
- **Verification**: RiskManager.shutdown() explicitly calls `clearInterval(this.alertCleanupTimer)`
- **Implementation**: Called during bot shutdown sequence (line 1756)
- **Status**: PROPERLY CLEANED UP - No timer leaks on restart ✅

#### ✅ BUG #5: Pattern Memory File I/O Queue (VERIFIED EXECUTES SAVES)
- **File**: `core/EnhancedPatternRecognition.js:325-335`
- **Verification**: Queue properly processes saves with `setImmediate(() => this.saveToDisk())`
- **Implementation**: If queue had items, executes additional save to capture pending changes
- **Status**: QUEUE EXECUTES SAVE - Pattern file never left in inconsistent state ✅

#### ✅ BUG #6: TradingBrain StateManager Async Calls (VERIFIED ACCEPTABLE)
- **File**: `core/OptimizedTradingBrain.js:1202-1210`
- **Verification**: Fire-and-forget design with `.catch()` error handlers
- **Implementation**: Intentional async pattern - trades don't block on StateManager sync
- **Status**: ACCEPTABLE DESIGN - Errors logged to ErrorHandler, trading continues ✅

#### ✅ BUG #7: Frontend State Update Handler (VERIFIED COMPLETE)
- **Files**: 
  - Backend: `core/StateManager.js:344-370` broadcasts state_update
  - Connection: `run-empire-v2.js:417` connects StateManager to dashboardWs
  - Frontend: `public-refactor/unified-dashboard-refactor.html:1212-1230` handles state_update
- **Verification**: 
  - StateManager broadcasts `state: {position, balance, totalBalance, totalPnL, tradeCount, dailyTradeCount, recoveryMode}`
  - Frontend receives `data.state.totalPnL` and updates element id="totalPnl"
  - Frontend receives `data.state.tradeCount` and updates element id="tradesExecuted"
  - Both HTML element IDs exist at lines 964 and 972
- **Status**: FULLY WIRED - Dashboard displays live P&L and trade count ✅

## [2.0.20] - 2025-12-11 - FIX: DASHBOARD DATA STRUCTURE MISMATCHES

### Fixed
- **Dashboard not receiving data from backend (message type mismatches)**
  - Problem: Backend sends different message types than frontend expects
  - Original: Backend sent `market_update`, `trade_update` but frontend expected `price`, `trade`
  - Impact: Dashboard showed nothing - all data was ignored

### Changed (Backend - send correct types)
- **run-empire-v2.js**
  - Line 679: Changed `type: 'market_update'` → `type: 'price'` to match frontend
  
- **core/AdvancedExecutionLayer-439-MERGED.js**
  - Line 578: Changed `type: 'trade_update'` → `type: 'trade'` to match frontend

### Changed (Frontend - added fallback handlers)
- **unified-dashboard.html handleWebSocketMessage()**
  - Added handler for `market_update` (backwards compatibility)
  - Added handler for `trade_update` (backwards compatibility)
  - Added handler for `state_update` → updates P&L, balance, trade count (from StateManager)
  - Added handler for `pattern_analysis` → shows pattern name, confidence, indicators
  - Added handler for `bot_thinking` with `step: 'trai_analysis'` → shows TRAI reasoning

### Message Type Mapping (Final)
| Backend Type | Source | Frontend Handler | Data Displayed |
|-------------|--------|------------------|----------------|
| `price` | run-empire-v2.js | updateChart() | Price chart, candles |
| `trade` | AdvancedExecutionLayer | logDecision() | Trade log, stats |
| `state_update` | StateManager | direct updates | Balance, P&L, trade count |
| `pattern_analysis` | run-empire-v2.js | pattern display | Pattern name, confidence |

### Verification
- Open dashboard at ws://127.0.0.1:3010/ws
- Price chart should update with candles
- Trade log should show BUY/SELL decisions
- Pattern section should show detected patterns

## [2.0.19] - 2025-12-11 - FIX: DASHBOARD SHOWS STALE DATA

### Fixed
- **Dashboard shows old state during trade execution (stale P&L, position)**
  - Problem: Dashboard updates sent BEFORE StateManager updates
  - Impact: Shows profit when actually in loss, wrong position sizes
  - Fix: StateManager now broadcasts to dashboard AFTER every state change

### Changed
- **core/StateManager.js**
  - Added `setDashboardWs(ws)` method to connect dashboard WebSocket
  - Added `broadcastToDashboard(updates, context)` method
  - `notifyListeners()` now automatically broadcasts to dashboard after state changes
  - Dashboard receives: position, balance, totalPnL, tradeCount, recoveryMode

- **run-empire-v2.js**
  - Line 415-416: Connect StateManager to dashboard WebSocket on open

- **core/PerformanceDashboardIntegration.js**
  - Commented out TradingSafetyNet (module doesn't exist)
  - Set `enableSafetyTracking: false` by default
  - `this.safetyNet = null` to prevent crashes

### How It Works
1. Trade executes → StateManager.openPosition() or closePosition()
2. StateManager updates internal state atomically
3. StateManager calls notifyListeners() 
4. notifyListeners() calls broadcastToDashboard()
5. Dashboard receives `state_update` message with CURRENT accurate state
6. No more stale data - dashboard always shows post-update state

## [2.0.18] - 2025-12-11 - FIX: WEBSOCKET RACE CONDITIONS (MESSAGE QUEUE)

### Fixed
- **WebSocket messages processed out of order causing duplicate/missed trades**
  - Location: `run-empire-v2.js` lines 567-575, `core/MessageQueue.js` (new)
  - Problem: WebSocket messages processed directly without queuing
  - Impact: Concurrent execution allowed Message B to complete before Message A
  - Symptom: Price data processed out of order, stale indicators, duplicate trades
  - Fix: Added MessageQueue class with FIFO processing and sequence tracking

### Added
- **core/MessageQueue.js** - WebSocket message queue for ordered processing
  - Sequential message processing (no concurrent execution)
  - Sequence numbering to track message order
  - Stale message detection and dropping (>3s old)
  - Queue overflow protection (max 50 messages)
  - 5ms minimum gap between message processing
  - Stats tracking: received/processed/dropped counts

### Changed
- **run-empire-v2.js**
  - Line 57-58: Import MessageQueue
  - Line 317-324: Initialize messageQueue in constructor
  - Line 573-575: Changed from direct `handleMarketData(ohlcArray)` to `messageQueue.add(ohlcArray)`

### How It Works
1. WebSocket receives OHLC message
2. Message added to queue with sequence number and timestamp
3. Queue processes messages one-by-one in FIFO order
4. Stale messages (>3s old) are dropped
5. Minimum 5ms gap prevents CPU overload during rapid updates

## [2.0.17] - 2025-12-11 - CRITICAL FIX: TRADES NOT EXECUTING (PHANTOM TRADE BUG)

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL: Trades registering but NOT executing (ReferenceError: orderId is undefined)**
  - Location: `run-empire-v2.js` line 1234
  - Bug: `orderId` was referenced but never defined in local scope
  - Impact: `stateManager.openPosition()` threw ReferenceError, silently failing
  - Symptom: BUY signals fire, trade registers with RiskManager, but position stays 0
  - Fix: Changed `orderId` → `unifiedResult.orderId`
  - This was the PHANTOM TRADE bug - trades appeared to execute but StateManager never updated

### Root Cause Analysis
- v2.0.15 integrated StateManager with syntax error
- Line 1234 referenced `orderId` (undefined variable)
- Should have been `unifiedResult.orderId` or `tradeResult.orderId`
- JavaScript silently threw ReferenceError inside try-catch
- Error was caught but not logged, causing silent failure
- Position stayed at 0, balance stayed at $10000 forever

### Verification
- CP5 checkpoint now reaches CP6 checkpoint
- StateManager position updates correctly after BUY
- Balance decreases by position size after BUY

## [2.0.16] - 2025-12-11 - CRITICAL FIXES: ERROR ESCALATION & MEMORY MANAGEMENT

### Fixed
- **Error Swallowing in OptimizedTradingBrain.js**
  - Line 983: StateManager.openPosition() - Now escalates via ErrorHandler.reportCritical()
  - Line 1164: logTrade() - Now escalates via ErrorHandler.reportWarning()
  - Line 1200: StateManager.closePosition() - Now escalates via ErrorHandler.reportCritical()
  - Circuit breaker triggers at 5 errors per module
  - Critical errors properly tracked and logged

- **Memory Leaks in OptimizedTradingBrain.js**
  - Line 47: `this.tradeHistory = []` → `this.tradeHistory = new RollingWindow(100)`
  - Fixed: Unbounded trade history now caps at 100 items (FIFO)
  - Memory estimate: ~100 trades * 5KB avg = 500KB max (instead of unbounded)

### Added
- **core/ErrorHandler.js** - Centralized error management with circuit breaker
  - `reportCritical(moduleName, error, context)` - Circuit breaks at 5 errors
  - `reportWarning(moduleName, error, context)` - Logged non-critical errors
  - Module-specific error tracking and stats
  - Automatic recovery after 60 seconds

- **core/MemoryManager.js** - Three window types for memory management
  - `RollingWindow(size)` - Fixed-size FIFO buffer
  - `TimeBasedWindow(maxAgeMs)` - Time-window cleanup
  - `HybridWindow(size, maxAgeMs)` - Combined constraints

### Changed
- **OptimizedTradingBrain.js**
  - Line 30-31: Added imports for ErrorHandler and RollingWindow
  - Line 44-49: Initialize ErrorHandler in constructor
  - Line 54: Changed tradeHistory to RollingWindow (memory leak fix)
  - All silent error catches now properly escalate

### Status
- Bot at Candle #4/15 ✓
- 708 patterns loaded ✓
- ErrorHandler integrated ✓
- Memory capping implemented ✓
- Ready for extended testing (24+ hours)

### Next
- Integrate ErrorHandler into EnhancedPatternRecognition.js
- Replace unbounded arrays in PerformanceAnalyzer.js
- Integrate MemoryManager into MarketRegimeDetector.js

## [2.0.15] - 2025-12-11 - STATEMANAGER INTEGRATION COMPLETE

### Changed
- **run-empire-v2.js: Full StateManager Integration**
  - Line 53-54: Import StateManager singleton
  - Line 289-302: Remove `this.currentPosition`, initialize StateManager with starting balance
  - Line 857-870: Replace position reads with `stateManager.get('position')`
  - Line 986-1029: Replace all position checks in `makeTradeDecision()`
  - Line 1224-1241: BUY now uses `stateManager.openPosition()` for atomic update
  - Line 1265-1293: SELL error handling uses `stateManager.emergencyReset()`
  - Line 1315-1360: SELL now uses `stateManager.closePosition()` for atomic update
  - Line 1412: Remove duplicate `this.currentPosition = 0` (handled by StateManager)
  - Lines 674, 906, 1108, 1123: All position reads now use StateManager

- **OptimizedTradingBrain.js: StateManager Sync**
  - Line 30: Import StateManager singleton
  - Line 970-977: `openPosition()` now syncs to StateManager after local update
  - Line 1187-1194: `closePosition()` now syncs to StateManager before clearing position
  - TradingBrain keeps its internal `this.position` for breakeven/trailing logic
  - StateManager stays in sync for global consistency

- **AdvancedExecutionLayer-439-MERGED.js: StateManager Import**
  - Line 13: Import StateManager singleton (ready for future sync)
  - Positions Map kept for multi-order tracking (different purpose)

### Fixed
- **Single Source of Truth for Position Tracking**
  - `this.currentPosition` completely removed from run-empire-v2.js
  - All reads go through `stateManager.get('position')`
  - All updates go through `stateManager.openPosition()` / `closePosition()`
  - TradingBrain and ExecutionLayer sync to StateManager on position changes
  - No more desync between multiple position tracking locations

## [2.0.14] - 2025-12-11 - CRITICAL STATE MANAGEMENT FIX

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL: Position/Balance Desynchronization**
  - Location: NEW `core/StateManager.js`
  - Problem: Position tracked in 3 different places (currentPosition, tradingBrain.position, executionLayer.positions)
  - Impact: Phantom trades, wrong sizes, failed exits
  - Solution: Centralized StateManager with atomic updates
  - All state changes now go through single source of truth

### Added
- **StateManager - Centralized State Management**
  - Atomic state updates (no partial corruption)
  - Transaction logging for debugging
  - State validation before trades
  - Emergency reset capability
  - Lock mechanism for race condition prevention

### Impact
- Fixes position desync causing phantom trades
- Prevents balance inconsistencies
- Enables proper state recovery after crashes
- Foundation for distributed trading (multiple instances)

## [2.0.13] - 2025-12-11 - TRADING OPTIMIZATION FRAMEWORK

### Added
- **Three-pass trading optimization system**
  - Location: `core/TradingOptimizations.js` (new file)
  - Pass 1: DecisionContext for complete trade visibility
  - Pass 2: Pattern-based position sizing (0.25x to 1.5x multiplier)
  - Pass 3: Elite bipole pattern filtering (ready but not active)

- **Pattern Stats Manager**
  - Tracks win/loss rates per pattern
  - Calculates pattern quality scores
  - Enables smart position sizing based on historical performance

- **Integration into main bot**
  - Modified: `run-empire-v2.js` lines 49-52, 941-953, 1004-1011, 1115-1121
  - Every trade now has full context logging
  - Position sizes adjust based on pattern quality
  - Configuration flags for safe feature rollout

### Configuration
- `enableDecisionContext`: true (visibility only, no behavior change)
- `enablePatternSizeScaling`: false (ready to enable)
- `enablePerfectBipoleFilter`: false (ready to enable)

### Impact
- Zero behavior change with flags disabled
- Full visibility into WHY each trade fires
- Foundation for learning-based position sizing
- Preparation for "elite patterns only" mode

## [2.0.12] - 2025-12-11 - PATTERN MEMORY ACTUALLY WORKING! 🚀

### Fixed
- **BREAKTHROUGH: Pattern memory is FINALLY accumulating after 6+ months!**
  - Location: `core/EnhancedPatternRecognition.js:848-859`
  - Problem: `recordPatternResult()` was receiving signature strings but expecting features arrays
  - Root Cause: Type mismatch - patterns created with features but recorded with signatures
  - Fix: Strict validation requiring features arrays only (no string fallback)
  - Impact: Pattern count jumped from 1 → 128+ in first hour of operation
  - **This is the fix that changes everything - bot can finally LEARN**

### Verified
- Pattern memory growing in real-time (128+ patterns and climbing)
- Each candle successfully recording patterns
- No more "signature string" warnings
- Pattern persistence working across restarts
- Dashboard integration confirmed working

### Dashboard Integration
- Pattern count now visible in dashboard
- Real-time pattern growth monitoring
- Pattern success rates calculating correctly
- Memory utilization tracking active

## [2.0.11] - 2025-12-10 - CRITICAL PATTERN MEMORY FIX

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL: Pattern memory accumulation finally fixed (6+ MONTH BUG)**
  - Location: `core/EnhancedPatternRecognition.js:301`
  - Problem: `saveToDisk()` was saving `this.memory` which is a PatternMemorySystem CLASS INSTANCE
  - Impact: Patterns never accumulated, only BASE_PATTERN was ever saved
  - Fix: Now saves `this.memory.memory` (the actual patterns object inside the class)
  - This explains why bot never learned from trades for 6+ months

- **Kill switch removed**
  - Location: `core/AdvancedExecutionLayer-439-MERGED.js:85-95`
  - Problem: Kill switch was left active since Dec 8 MCP disaster
  - Impact: ALL trades blocked for 2+ days
  - Fix: Commented out kill switch check and removed flag file

## [2.0.10] - 2025-12-10 - PARTIAL FIXES & INFRASTRUCTURE

### Fixed
- **Claude model name in orchestrator**
  - File: `devtools/claudito/claudito-bug-orchestrator.js` line 23
  - Changed from non-existent `claude-3-opus-latest` to real `claude-3-opus-20240229`
  - Impact: Claudito can now actually call Claude API

- **One saveToDisk error (partial)**
  - File: `core/EnhancedPatternRecognition.js` line 853
  - Changed `this.saveToDisk()` to `this.memory.saveToDisk()`
  - Note: MORE saveToDisk errors remain at lines 225, 432, 435, 710

### Infrastructure
- **Auto-patcher permanently disabled**
  - Moved `apply-claudito-patches.js` to `_disabled/` folder
  - Removed execute permissions
  - Claudito now report-only, no automatic patches

### Status
- Bot runs but still has errors
- Waiting for Opus forensics report for remaining fixes
- Manual fix workflow established

## [2.0.9] - 2025-12-09 - CRITICAL BRACE FIX

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL: Extra closing brace broke PatternMemorySystem class**
  - File: `core/EnhancedPatternRecognition.js` line 290
  - Bug: Extra `}` pushed saveToDisk() method outside class
  - Fix: Removed extra brace, properly closed initializeSeedPatterns()
  - Impact: THIS WAS THE ROOT CAUSE - saveToDisk is now accessible
  - Status: ✅ Bot running for 10+ minutes without crashes

## [2.0.8] - 2025-12-09 - AUTOMATED FIXER DAMAGE CONTROL

### Reverted
- Reverted to commit `cad46cf` after automated fixer disaster
- Automated fixer created more problems than it solved:
  - Added extra closing braces breaking class structure
  - Created syntax errors in try-catch blocks
  - Misplaced methods outside classes
- Lesson learned: NO MORE AUTOMATED FIXERS

### Fixed
- **saveToDisk is not a function (6+ MONTH BUG FINALLY FIXED)**
  - File: `core/EnhancedPatternRecognition.js` line 235
  - Problem: Called `this.saveToDisk()` which doesn't exist
  - Fix: Changed to `this.savePatternMemory()`
  - Status: ✅ FIXED and verified working

- **toFixed() undefined errors in Discord notifications**
  - Files: `utils/discordNotifier.js` lines 300-304
  - Problem: Calling toFixed() on undefined values (totalPnL, bestTrade, worstTrade)
  - Fix: Added null checks with fallback to "0.00"
  - Applied aggressive fix wrapping all toFixed() calls

- **trim() undefined errors in TRAI persistent LLM**
  - File: `core/trai_core.js` line 352
  - Problem: Calling trim() on undefined/null response from LLM
  - Fix: Added null check with fallback to empty string

- **Kill Switch Emergency Stop System**
  - File: `core/KillSwitch.js` (new)
  - Purpose: Emergency trading stop during debugging
  - Integrated into AdvancedExecutionLayer.js
  - Activation: Create `killswitch.flag` file to stop all trades

### Testing & Validation
- Claudito Bomber successfully detected ALL production errors
- Applied fixes using automated patching scripts
- Created full backup/restore system (7 backup files)
- Restore script: `/opt/ogzprime/OGZPMLV2/devtools/claudito/RESTORE-ALL-BACKUPS.sh`

## [2.0.4] - 2025-12-07 - CRITICAL PATTERN SAVE FIX

### Fixed
- **Pattern Memory Never Saving to Disk (6+ MONTH BUG)**
  - File: `core/EnhancedPatternRecognition.js` line 850
  - Problem: `recordPatternResult()` method never called `savePatternMemory()`
  - Root Cause: Missing save call after recording patterns
  - Issue: Patterns were recorded in memory but NEVER persisted to disk
  - Fix: Added `this.savePatternMemory()` call after recording
  - Impact: Bot can FINALLY save learned patterns to pattern_memory.json
  - Test Result: Patterns now persist across restarts and grow properly

## [2.0.3] - 2025-12-06 - PATTERN RECORDING TO FILE FIX

### Fixed
- **Patterns Not Being Saved to pattern_memory.json**
  - File: `run-empire-v2.js` lines 741-760
  - Problem: Patterns detected but never saved to memory file
  - Root Cause: `recordPatternResult` only called when trades complete
  - Issue: Machine-gunning trades (rapid buy-sell) never properly complete
  - Fix: Record patterns IMMEDIATELY when detected, not after trade completion
  - Impact: Bot can finally build persistent pattern memory across restarts

## [2.0.2] - 2025-12-06 - PATTERN RECORDING FIX

### Fixed
- **Pattern Memory Not Recording New Trades**
  - File: `core/EnhancedPatternRecognition.js` lines 773-784
  - Problem: Pattern memory stuck at 2 entries for 10+ hours despite trades executing
  - Root Cause: `analyzePatterns` only returned patterns when `evaluatePattern` had confidence > 0
  - Issue: New patterns need 3+ occurrences to build confidence (chicken & egg problem)
  - Fix: Removed `if (result)` check - now ALWAYS returns patterns with minimum 0.1 confidence
  - Impact: Bot can finally learn from ALL patterns and build confidence over time
  - Test Result: Pattern memory now growing (3+ patterns loaded vs stuck at 2)

## [2.0.1] - 2025-12-05 - CRITICAL PATTERN MEMORY FIX & MODULE CLEANUP

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL BUG**: Pattern memory was being wiped on every bot restart for 3+ MONTHS
  - File: `core/EnhancedPatternRecognition.js` line 246
  - Bug: Only checked `if (this.patternCount === 0)` to init seed patterns
  - Problem: This wiped ALL existing patterns even when memory had patterns
  - Fix: Changed to `if (Object.keys(this.memory).length === 0 && this.patternCount === 0)`
  - Impact: Bot lost ALL learned patterns every restart - couldn't learn anything

- **Discord Notifier**: Module export was missing
  - File: `utils/discordNotifier.js`
  - Added: `module.exports = DiscordTradingNotifier;`

- **Pattern Memory Format**: Fixed structure
  - File: `pattern_memory.json`
  - Changed from flat object to `{"patterns": {...}, "count": 1}` format

### Added
- **PatternMemoryBank.js**: New module at `core/PatternMemoryBank.js`
  - Purpose: TRAI AI pattern learning (separate from chart patterns)
  - Methods: recordPattern(), getSuccessfulPatterns(), pruneOldPatterns()
  - Saves to: `trai_brain/learned_patterns.json`

- **ModuleAutoLoader**: Added to `run-empire-v2.js` lines 27-29
  - MAY HAVE BROKEN BOT - bot exits after 2 candles with this change
  - Code added:
    ```javascript
    const loader = require('./core/ModuleAutoLoader');
    const modules = loader.loadAll();
    ```

### Fixed (Round 2)
- **Pattern initialization chicken-egg problem**
  - File: `core/EnhancedPatternRecognition.js` lines 266-288
  - Problem: Bot needs patterns to run, but can't learn patterns if it can't run
  - Old bug: Wiped all patterns but at least provided fresh ones
  - First fix: Preserved patterns but provided none on first run (bot couldn't start)
  - Final fix: Always ensures at least one BASE_PATTERN exists for startup
  - Now: Bot can start AND preserves learned patterns

### Fixed (Round 3)
- **ModuleAutoLoader causing bot to hang**
  - Problem: Bot would get stuck after Candle #2 and stop processing
  - Root cause: ModuleAutoLoader pre-loaded all modules, but bot still had direct require() statements
  - This caused double-loading and async/sync conflicts
  - Bot didn't exit - it got stuck waiting indefinitely
  - Solution: REMOVED ModuleAutoLoader from run-empire-v2.js
  - Bot now uses original direct require() statements as designed

### Fixed (Round 5) - CRITICAL: Bot running with EMPTY STUB CLASSES
- **Root cause of Candle #2 death identified**
  - File: `run-empire-v2.js` lines 78-87
  - Problem: ModuleAutoLoader stores modules as `{core: {...}, utils: {...}}`
  - Code was trying: `modules.EnhancedPatternRecognition` (undefined)
  - Fell back to: `|| { EnhancedPatternChecker: class {} }` (EMPTY CLASS)
  - Bot was running with DUMMY MODULES instead of real ones!
  ```javascript
  // WRONG - creates empty stub classes:
  const { EnhancedPatternChecker } = modules.EnhancedPatternRecognition || { EnhancedPatternChecker: class {} };
  // Result: EnhancedPatternChecker is literally "class {}" with NO methods
  ```
  - On Candle #2: tries to call methods on empty class → undefined → silent exit
  - No error because it's not a crash, just calling undefined methods
  - Singleton lock releases cleanly because bot "completed" (with nothing)

### Fixed (Round 6) - Proper ModuleAutoLoader integration
- **run-empire-v2.js uses loader.get() properly**
  - File: `run-empire-v2.js` lines 73-92
  - Changed all module access to use loader.get('core', 'ModuleName')
  - Added debug logging to verify modules are loading
  - Added safety check to exit if EnhancedPatternChecker undefined
  ```javascript
  // CORRECT - uses loader API:
  const EnhancedPatternRecognition = loader.get('core', 'EnhancedPatternRecognition');
  const RiskManager = loader.get('core', 'RiskManager');
  ```
  - This is how ModuleAutoLoader was designed to be used
  - No more stub classes, no more empty modules

### Fixed (Round 5) - ModuleAutoLoader module access
- **run-empire-v2.js module structure fix**
  - File: `run-empire-v2.js` lines 46-52
  - Problem: loader.loadAll() returns nested structure {core: {...}, utils: {...}}
  - Was trying: modules.SingletonLock (undefined)
  - Should be: modules.core.SingletonLock
  - Fix: Flatten modules object for direct access
  ```javascript
  const allModules = loader.loadAll();
  const modules = {
    ...allModules.core,
    ...allModules.utils
  };
  ```
  - Now all modules accessible directly: modules.SingletonLock, modules.RiskManager, etc.

### Changed (Round 4) - ModuleAutoLoader as Single Source of Truth
- **ModuleAutoLoader instance caching**
  - File: `core/ModuleAutoLoader.js` lines 172-193
  - Added: Cache Map for module instances to prevent re-loading
  - Now caches module instances, not just file paths
  - Prevents multiple instances of same module being created

- **run-empire-v2.js converted to use ModuleAutoLoader**
  - File: `run-empire-v2.js` lines 40-95
  - Changed ALL module requires to use ModuleAutoLoader
  - Line 42: Added `const loader = require('./core/ModuleAutoLoader')`
  - Line 46: Added `const modules = loader.loadAll()`
  - Lines 73-82: Replaced direct requires with `modules.ModuleName || class {}`
    - EnhancedPatternChecker from modules.EnhancedPatternRecognition
    - OptimizedTradingBrain from modules.OptimizedTradingBrain
    - RiskManager from modules.RiskManager
    - ExecutionRateLimiter from modules.ExecutionRateLimiter
    - AdvancedExecutionLayer from modules['AdvancedExecutionLayer-439-MERGED']
    - PerformanceAnalyzer from modules.PerformanceAnalyzer
    - OptimizedIndicators from modules.OptimizedIndicators
    - MarketRegimeDetector from modules.MarketRegimeDetector
    - TradingProfileManager from modules.TradingProfileManager
    - GridTradingStrategy from modules.GridTradingStrategy
  - Line 90: TRAIDecisionModule from modules.TRAIDecisionModule
  - Line 95: OgzTpoIntegration from modules.OgzTpoIntegration
  - Kept direct requires for:
    - KrakenAdapterSimple (not in core/utils)
    - TierFeatureFlags (in root directory)
  - ModuleAutoLoader is now the SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH for module loading

- **EMPIRE-V2-PRINCIPLES.md**: Architecture documentation

### Changed
- **AdvancedExecutionLayer**: Discord method name
  - File: `core/AdvancedExecutionLayer-439-MERGED.js`
  - Changed: `sendTradeNotification()` → `sendMessage()`

- **pattern_memory.json**: Structure update
  - Old: Flat pattern object
  - New: `{"patterns": {...}, "count": N}` format

### Removed
- Duplicate files from root directory (moved to core/)
- Test files and temporary scripts
